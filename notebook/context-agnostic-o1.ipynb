To date, seven national space programs have flown non-human animals into space: the United States, Soviet Union, France, Argentina, China, Japan and Iran.\\n\\nA wide variety of non-human animals have been launched into space, including monkeys and apes, dogs, cats, tortoises, mice, rats, rabbits, fish, frogs, spiders, insects, and quail eggs (which hatched on Mir in 1990). The US launched the first Earthlings into space, with fruit flies surviving a 1947 flight, followed by primates in 1949. The Soviet space program launched multiple dogs into space, with the first sub-orbital flights in 1951, and first orbital flights in 1957.[1]\\n\\nTwo tortoises and several varieties of plants were the first Earthlings to circle the Moon in September 1968 on the Zond 5 mission. In 1972, five mice nicknamed Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey orbited the Moon a record 75 times aboard command module America as part of the Apollo 17 mission (the most recent to put Earthlings into lunar orbit).\\n\\nAnimals had been used in aeronautic exploration since 1783 when the Montgolfier brothers sent a sheep, a duck, and a rooster aloft in a hot air balloon to see if ground-dwelling animals can survive (the duck serving as the experimental control). The limited supply of captured German V-2 rockets led to the U.S. use of high-altitude balloon launches carrying fruit flies, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, frogs, goldfish and monkeys to heights of up to 44,000\\xa0m (144,000\\xa0ft; 27\\xa0mi).[2] These high-altitude balloon flights from 1947 to 1960 tested radiation exposure, physiological response, life support and recovery systems. The U.S. high-altitude manned balloon flights occurred in the same time frame, one of which also carried fruit flies.\\n\\nThe first animals sent into space were fruit flies aboard a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on 20 February 1947 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.[2][3][4][5] The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached 109\\xa0km (68\\xa0mi) in 3 minutes 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force 80\\xa0km (50\\xa0mi) and the \\ninternational 100\\xa0km definitions of the boundary of space. The Blossom capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive. Other V-2 missions carried biological samples, including moss.\\n\\nAlbert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first monkey, first primate, and first mammal in space on 14 June 1949, in a U.S.-launched V-2, after the failure of the original Albert\\'s mission on ascent. Albert I reached only 48–63\\xa0km (30–39\\xa0mi) altitude; Albert II reached about 134\\xa0km (83\\xa0mi), and died on impact after a parachute failure. \\n\\nNumerous monkeys of several species were flown by the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s. Monkeys were implanted with sensors to measure vital signs, and many were under anesthesia during launch. The death rate among these monkeys was very high: about two-thirds of all monkeys launched in the 1940s and 1950s died on missions or soon after landing.[6]\\n\\nOn 31 August 1950, the U.S. launched a mouse into space (137\\xa0km) aboard a V-2 (the Albert V flight, which, unlike the Albert I-IV flights, did not have a monkey), however, the animal died following descent because the parachute system failed.[7] The U.S. launched several other mice in the 1950s.\\n\\nOn 22 July 1951, the Soviet Union launched the R-1 IIIA-1 flight, carrying the dogs Tsygan  (Russian: Цыган, \"Gypsy\" or \"Țigan/Țagaur\" in romani language) and Dezik (Russian: Дезик) into space, but not into orbit.[8] These two dogs were the first living higher organisms successfully recovered from a spaceflight.[8] Both space dogs survived the flight, although Dezik would die on a subsequent flight. The U.S. launched mice aboard spacecraft later that year; however, they failed to reach the altitude for true spaceflight.\\n\\nOn 3 November 1957, the second-ever orbiting spacecraft carried the first animal into orbit, the dog Laika,[1] launched aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft (nicknamed \\'Muttnik\\' in the West). Laika died during the flight, as was expected because the technology to return spacecraft from orbit had not yet been developed.[1] At least 10 other dogs were launched into orbit and numerous others on sub-orbital flights before the historic date of 12 April 1961, when Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space.\\n\\nOn 13 December 1958, a Jupiter IRBM, AM-13, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, with a United States Navy-trained South American squirrel monkey named Gordo on board. The nose cone recovery parachute failed to operate and Gordo was lost. Telemetry data sent back during the flight showed that the monkey survived the 10\\xa0g of launch, 8 minutes of weightlessness and 40\\xa0g of reentry at 16,000\\xa0km/h (4,400\\xa0m/s; 9,900\\xa0mph). The nose cone sank 1,302 nautical miles (2,411\\xa0km) downrange from Cape Canaveral and was not recovered.\\n\\nMonkeys Miss Able and Miss Baker became the first monkeys to survive spaceflight after their 1959 flight. On 28 May 1959, aboard Jupiter IRBM AM-18, were a 3\\xa0kg (7\\xa0lb) American-born rhesus monkey, Able, from Independence, Kansas, and a 310\\xa0g (11\\xa0oz) squirrel monkey from Peru, Baker. The monkeys rode in the nose cone of the missile to an altitude of 579\\xa0km (360\\xa0mi) and a distance of 2,735\\xa0km (1,699\\xa0mi) down the Atlantic Missile Range from Cape Canaveral, Florida. They withstood forces 38 times the normal pull of gravity and were weightless for about 9 minutes. A top speed of 16,000\\xa0km/h (4,400\\xa0m/s; 9,900\\xa0mph) was reached during their 16-minute flight. The monkeys survived the flight in good condition. Able died four days after the flight from a reaction to anesthesia, while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode. Baker was the center of media attention for the next several months as she was watched closely for any ill-effects from her space flight. She was even mated in an attempt to test her reproductive system.[9] Baker lived until 29 November 1984, at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\\n\\nOn 2 July 1959, a launch of a Soviet R2 rocket, which reached 212 kilometres (132\\xa0mi), carried two space dogs and Marfusha, the first rabbit to go into space.[2]\\n\\nA 19 September 1959 launch, a Jupiter AM-23, carried two frogs and 12 mice but was destroyed during launch.[2]\\n\\nOn 4 December 1959, a rhesus macaque Sam flew on the Little Joe 2 mission of Project Mercury to an altitude of 85\\xa0km (53\\xa0mi).[2]\\n\\nOn 19 August 1960 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 5 (also known as Korabl-Sputnik 2) which carried the dogs Belka and Strelka, along with a gray rabbit, 40 mice, 2 rats, and 15 flasks of fruit flies and plants.[10] It was the first spacecraft to carry animals into orbit and return them alive.[11] One of Strelka\\'s pups, Pushinka, bred and born after her mission, was given as a present to Caroline Kennedy by Nikita Khrushchev in 1961, and many descendants are known to exist.[12]\\n\\nThe US sent three black mice: Sally, Amy and Moe 1,000\\xa0km up and 8,000\\xa0km distance from Cape Canaveral on 13 October 1960 using an Atlas D 71D launch vehicle.  The mice were retrieved from the nosecone near Ascension Island and were said to be in good condition.[13]\\n\\nOn 31 January 1961, Ham, a chimpanzee, was launched into sub-orbital space in a Mercury capsule aboard a Redstone rocket to become the first great ape in space. Ham\\'s mission was Mercury-Redstone 2. The chimpanzee had been trained to pull levers to receive rewards of banana pellets and avoid electric shocks.[14] His flight demonstrated the ability to perform tasks during spaceflight. A little over three months later the United States sent Alan Shepard into space on a suborbital flight. \\n\\nEnos became the first and only chimpanzee to reach Earth orbit when, on 29 November 1961, he flew two orbits in a Mercury capsule on the Mercury-Atlas 5 mission.  Two months later Project Mercury pilot John Glenn orbited the Earth. \\n\\nOn 9 March 1961 the Soviet Union launched the Korabl-Sputnik 4 that carried a dog named Chernushka, some mice, and, for the first time into space, a guinea pig.[15] All were successfully recovered.\\n\\nFrance flew their first rat (Hector) into space on 22 February 1961. Two more rats were flown in October 1962.[16]\\n\\nOn 18 October 1963, France launched Félicette the cat aboard Veronique AGI sounding rocket No. 47. The launch was directed by the French Centre d\\'Enseignement et de Recherches de Médecine Aéronautique (CERMA). Félicette was recovered alive after a 15-minute flight and a descent by parachute. Félicette had electrodes implanted into her brain, and the recorded neural impulses were transmitted back to Earth. After two months of analysis, she was euthanized so an autopsy could be performed.[17] On 18 December 2019 a bronze statue with the effigy of Félicette was inaugurated at the \"Université internationalle de l\\'espace\" in Strasbourg, France. A second cat was sent to space by CERMA on 24 October 1963, but the flight ran into difficulties that prevented recovery.[18] In 1967, France launched two pig-tailed macaque monkeys into suborbital space.[19]\\n\\nChina launched mice and rats in 1964 and 1965, and two dogs in 1966.[20]\\n\\nDuring the Voskhod program, two Soviet space dogs, Veterok (Ветерок, Little Wind) and Ugolyok (Уголёк, Blackie), were launched on 22 February 1966, on board Cosmos 110 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March. This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until Soyuz 11 in 1971 and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe US launched Biosatellite I in 1966 and Biosatellite I/II in 1967 with fruit flies, parasitic wasps, flour beetles and frog eggs, along with bacteria, amoebae, plants and fungi.[21]\\n\\nOn 11 April 1967, Argentina also launched the rat Belisario, atop a Yarará rocket,[22][self-published source?] from Cordoba military range, which was recovered successfully. This flight was followed by a series of subsequent flights using rats.[23] It is unclear if any Argentinean biological flights passed the 100\\xa0km limit of space.\\n\\nThe first animals in deep space, the first to circle the Moon, and the first two tortoises in space were launched on Zond 5 on 14 September 1968 by the Soviet Union. The Horsfield\\'s tortoises were sent on a circumlunar voyage to the Moon along with wine flies, meal worms, and other biological specimens. These were the first inhabitants of Earth to travel around the Moon. The capsule overshot its terrestrial landing site but was successfully recovered at sea on 21 September. The animals survived but underwent weight loss. More turtles followed on the circumlunar Zond 6 mission of November 1968 (ahead of the December U.S. crewed Apollo 8 mission) and four turtles flew on the circumlunar Zond 7 mission which flew around the Moon on August 11, 1969, three weeks after Apollo 11\\'s Moon walk.[24]\\n\\nOn 28 June 1969, the US launched the monkey Bonny, a macaque, on Biosatellite 3 in what was intended to have been a 30-day orbit around the Earth, with the monkey being fed by food pellets from a dispenser that he had been trained to operate.  Bonny\\'s health deteriorated rapidly and he was returned to Earth on 7 July,[25] but died the next day after the Biosatellite capsule was recovered in the Pacific Ocean.[26]\\n\\nIn total in the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union launched missions with at least 57 passenger slots for dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller, because some dogs flew more than once.\\n\\nOn 23 December 1969, as part of the \\'Operación Navidad\\' (Operation Christmas), Argentina launched Juan (a cai monkey, native of Argentina\\'s Misiones Province) using a Canopus II rocket.[27] It ascended 82 kilometers[28] and then was recovered successfully. Later, on 1 February 1970 the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using a X-1 Panther rocket. It reached a higher altitude than its predecessor, but it was lost after the capsule\\'s parachute failed.\\n\\nTwo bullfrogs were launched on a one-way mission on the Orbiting Frog Otolith satellite on 9 November 1970, to understand more about space motion sickness.\\n\\nApollo 16, launched on 16 April 1972, carried nematodes. Apollo 17, launched on 7 December 1972, carried five pocket mice, Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey, who stayed in the command module with astronaut Ronald Evans as it circled the Moon for six days. One of the mice died on the trip.[29]\\n\\nSkylab 3 (1973) carried pocket mice and the first fish in space (a mummichog), and the first spiders in space (garden spiders named Arabella and Anita). Mummichog were also flown by the U.S. on the Apollo–Soyuz joint mission, launched 15 July 1975.\\n\\nThe Soviets flew several Bion program missions which consisted of satellites with biological cargoes. On these launches they flew tortoises, rats, and mummichog. On Soyuz 20, launched 17 November 1975, tortoises set the duration record for an animal in space when they spent 90.5 days in space. Salyut 5 on 22 June 1976, carried tortoises and a fish (a zebra danio).\\n\\nThe Soviet Union sent eight monkeys into space in the 1980s on Bion flights. Bion flights also flew zebra danio, fruit flies, rats, stick insect eggs and the first newts in space.\\n\\nIn 1985, the U.S. sent two squirrel monkeys aboard Spacelab 3 on the Space Shuttle with 24 male albino rats and stick insect eggs.\\n\\nBion 7 (1985) had 10 newts (Pleurodeles waltl) on board. The newts had part of their front limbs amputated, to study the rate of regeneration in space, knowledge to understand human recovery from space injuries.\\n\\nAfter an experiment was lost in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, chicken embryos (fertilized eggs) were sent into space in an experiment on STS-29 in 1989. The experiment was designed for a student contest.\\n\\nFour monkeys flew aboard the last Bion flights of the Soviet Union as well as frogs and fruit flies. The Foton program flights carried dormant brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), newts, fruit flies, and sand desert beetles (Trigonoscelis gigas).[30][31]\\n\\nChina launched guinea pigs in 1990.[32]\\n\\nToyohiro Akiyama, a Japanese journalist, carried Japanese tree frogs with him during his trip to the Mir space station in December 1990. Other biological experiments aboard Mir involved quail eggs.\\n\\nIn 1994, four Japanese rice fish successfully mated and laid eggs that hatched to produce healthy fry aboard STS-65, making them the first animals to conceive and bear offspring in space.[33]\\n\\nJapan launched its first animals, a species of newt, into space on 18 March 1995 aboard the Space Flyer Unit.\\n\\nDuring the 1990s the U.S. carried crickets, mice, rats, frogs, newts, fruit flies, snails, carp, medaka (rice fish), oyster toadfish, sea urchins, swordtail fish, spongy moth eggs, stick insect eggs, brine shrimp (Artemia salina), quail eggs, and jellyfish aboard Space Shuttles.\\n\\nThe last flight of Columbia in 2003 carried silkworms, garden orb spiders, carpenter bees, harvester ants, and Japanese killifish (medaka). Nematodes (C. elegans) from one experiment were found still alive in the debris after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.[34]\\n\\nC. elegans are also part of experiments aboard the International Space Station as well as research using quail eggs.\\n\\nEarlier Space Shuttle missions included grade school, junior high and high school projects; some of these included ants, stick insect eggs and brine shrimp cysts. Other science missions included spongy moth eggs.\\n\\nOn 12 July 2006, Bigelow Aerospace launched their Genesis I inflatable space module, containing many small items such as toys and simple experiments chosen by company employees that would be observed via camera. These items included insects, perhaps making it the first private flight to launch animals into space. Included were Madagascar hissing cockroaches and Mexican jumping beans — seeds containing live larvae of the moth Cydia saltitans.[35] On 28 June 2007, Bigelow launched Genesis II, a near-twin to Genesis I.  This spacecraft also carried Madagascar hissing cockroaches and added South African flat rock scorpions (Hadogenes troglodytes) and seed-harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex californicus).[36]\\n\\nIn September 2007, during the European Space Agency\\'s FOTON-M3 mission, tardigrades, also known as water-bears, were able to survive 10 days of exposure to open-space with only their natural protection.[37][38]\\n\\nOn the same mission, a number of cockroaches were carried inside a sealed container and at least one of the females, named Nadezhda, conceived during the mission and produced 33 offspring after returning to Earth.[39]\\n\\nOn 15 March 2009, during the countdown of the STS-119, a free-tailed bat was seen clinging to the fuel tank. NASA observers believed the bat would fly off once the Shuttle started to launch, but it did not. Upon analyzing the images, a wildlife expert who provided support to the center said it likely had a broken left wing and some problem with its right shoulder or wrist. The animal most likely perished quickly during Discovery\\'s climb into orbit.[40]\\n\\nIn November 2009, STS-129 took painted lady and monarch butterfly larvae into space for a school experiment as well as thousands of C. elegans roundworms for long-term weight loss studies.\\n\\nIn May 2011, the last flight of Space Shuttle Endeavour (STS-134) carried two golden orb spiders, named Gladys and Esmeralda, as well as a fruit fly colony as their food source in order to study the effects of microgravity on spiders\\' behavior.[41][42] Tardigrades and extremophiles were also sent into orbit.[43][44][45]\\n\\nIn November 2011, the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment on the Fobos-Grunt mission planned to carry tardigrades to Mars and back; however, the mission failed to leave Earth orbit.\\n\\nIn October 2012, 32 medaka fish were delivered to the International Space Station by Soyuz TMA-06M for the new Aquatic Habitat in the Kibo module.\\n\\nOn 28 January 2013, Iranian news agencies reported that Iran sent a monkey in a \"Pishgam\" rocket to a height of 116\\xa0km (72\\xa0mi) and retrieved a \"shipment\". Later Iran\\'s space research website uploaded an 18-minute video.[46] The video was uploaded later on YouTube.[47]\\n\\nOn 3 February 2013, on the 31st anniversary of its revolution, Iran became the latest country to launch animals into space. The animals (a mouse, two turtles and some worms) were launched on top of the Kavoshgar 3 rocket and returned alive to Earth.[48][49]\\n\\nIn January 2014, the search strategies of pavement ants were studied on the ISS.[50][51]\\n\\nOn 19 July 2014, Russia announced that they launched their Foton-M4 satellite into low Earth orbit (575 kilometers) with one male and four female geckos (possibly gold dust day geckos) as the payload. This was an effort to study the effects of microgravity on reproductive habits of reptiles.[52] On 24 July 2014, it was announced that Russia had lost control of the Foton-M4 satellite, leaving only two months to restore contact before the geckos\\' food supply was exhausted.[53] Control of the satellite was subsequently restored on 28 July 2014.[54] On 1 September 2014 Russia confirmed the death of all five geckos, stating that their mummified bodies seem to indicate they froze to death. Russia is said to have appointed an emergency commission to investigate the animals\\' deaths.[55]\\n\\nOn 23 September 2014, SpaceX CRS-4 mission delivered 20 mice to live on the ISS for study of the long-term effects of microgravity on the rodents. This was the first use of the Rodent Research Hardware System.[56]\\n\\nOn 14 April 2015, the SpaceX CRS-6 delivered 20 C57BL/6NTAC mice to live on the ISS for evaluating microgravity as the extreme opposite of a healthy active lifestyle. In the absence of gravity, astronauts are subject to a decrease in muscle, bone, and tendon mass. \"Although, we\\'re not out to treat couch potatoes,\" states head Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research (NIBR) scientist on the project Dr. Sam Cadena, \"we\\'re hoping that these experiments will help us to better understand muscle loss in populations where physical activity in any form is not an option; e.g., in the frail elderly or those subjected to bed rest or immobilization due to surgery or chronic disease.\"[57]\\n\\nOn 8 April 2016, Rodent Research 3 delivered 20 mice on SpaceX CRS-8. The experiment sponsored by Eli Lilly and Co. was a study of myostatin inhibition for the prevention of skeletal and muscle atrophy and weakness. Mice are known to have  rapid loss of muscle and bone mass after as little as 12 days of space flight exposure. The mice were euthanized and dissected on the station and then frozen for eventual return to Earth for further study.[58]\\n\\nOn 29 June 2018, a SpaceX Dragon spaceship blasted off from Florida carrying 20 mice. The rodent crew arrived at the ISS on 2 July 2018. Their record-breaking journey – this was the longest mice have been off the planet – was part of a study on how Earth-dwellers\\' physiology and sleep schedules responded to the stress of being in space.[59]\\n\\nThe Chinese lunar lander Chang\\'e 4 carries a 3\\xa0kg sealed container with seeds and insect eggs to test whether plants and insects could hatch and grow together in synergy.[60] The experiment includes six types of organisms:[61][62] cottonseed, potato, rapeseed, Arabidopsis thaliana (a flowering plant), as well as yeast and fruit fly eggs. If the eggs hatch, the larvae would produce carbon dioxide, while the germinated plants would release oxygen through photosynthesis.[citation needed] A miniature camera is imaging the growth.[61]\\n\\nOn 11 April 2019, the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet crashed into the Moon during a failed landing attempt.[63] Its payload included a few thousand tardigrades. They could potentially survive on the lunar surface for some years, although it is unclear if they survived the impact.[64]\\n\\nOn 3 June 2021, SpaceX CRS-22 launched tardigrades (water bears) and Hawaiian bobtail squid to the ISS. The squid were launched as hatchlings and will be studied to see if they can incorporate their symbiotic bacteria into their light organ while in space.[65]\\n Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer who, as the commander of the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, became the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also a naval aviator, test pilot and university professor.\\n\\nArmstrong was born and raised near Wapakoneta, Ohio. He entered Purdue University, studying aeronautical engineering, with the United States Navy paying his tuition under the Holloway Plan.  He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS\\xa0Essex. After the war, he completed his bachelor\\'s degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force\\'s Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.\\n\\nArmstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in the second group, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA\\'s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot David Scott, he performed the first docking of two spacecraft; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong\\'s second and last spaceflight as commander of Apollo 11, he had to eject from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle moments before a crash.\\n\\nOn July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) pilot Buzz Aldrin became the first people to land on the Moon, and the next day they spent two and a half hours outside the Lunar Module Eagle spacecraft while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Apollo Command Module Columbia. When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That\\'s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. President Jimmy Carter presented him with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979, and with his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.\\n\\nAfter he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979. He served on the Apollo 13 accident investigation and on the Rogers Commission, which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In 2012, Armstrong died due to complications resulting from coronary bypass surgery, at the age of 82.\\n\\nArmstrong was born in rural Washington Township, in Auglaize County, Ohio,[5] on August 5, 1930, the son of Viola Louise (née Engel) and Stephen Koenig Armstrong. He was of German, English, Scots-Irish, and Scottish descent.[6][7] He is a descendant of Clan Armstrong.[8] He had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father was an auditor for the Ohio state government,[9] and the family moved around the state repeatedly, living in 16 towns over the next 14 years.[10] Armstrong\\'s love for flying grew during this time, having started at the age of two when his father took him to the Cleveland Air Races. When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio, when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor (also known as the \"Tin Goose\").[11][12]  Armstrong constructed and flew model aircraft, beginning in his youth.[13]\\n\\nThe family\\'s last move was in 1944 and took them back to Wapakoneta, where Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the Wapakoneta airfield.[14] He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed in August, all before he had a driver\\'s license.[15] He was an active Boy Scout and earned the rank of Eagle Scout.[16] As an adult, he was recognized by the Scouts with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award.[17][18] While flying toward the Moon on July 18, 1969, he sent his regards to attendees at the National Scout jamboree in Idaho.[19] Among the few personal items that he carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.[20]\\n\\nAt age 17, in 1947, Armstrong began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana; he was the second person in his family to attend college. Armstrong was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),[21] but he resolved to go to Purdue after watching a football game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Ohio Stadium in 1945 in which quarterback Bob DeMoss led the Boilermakers to a sound victory over the highly regarded Buckeyes.[22] An uncle who attended MIT had also advised him that he could receive a good education without going all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts. His college tuition was paid for under the Holloway Plan. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service as an aviator in the U.S. Navy, then completion of the final two years of their bachelor\\'s degree.[21] Armstrong did not take courses in naval science, nor did he join the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps.[23]\\n\\nArmstrong\\'s call-up from the Navy arrived on January 26, 1949, requiring him to report to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for flight training with class 5-49. After passing the medical examinations, he became a midshipman on February 24, 1949.[24] Flight training was conducted in a North American SNJ trainer, in which he soloed on September 9, 1949.[25] On March 2, 1950, he made his first aircraft carrier landing on USS\\xa0Cabot, an achievement he considered comparable to his first solo flight.[25] He was then sent to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi in Texas for training on the Grumman F8F Bearcat, culminating in a carrier landing on USS\\xa0Wright. On August 16, 1950, Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified naval aviator. His mother and sister attended his graduation ceremony on August 23, 1950.[26]\\n\\nArmstrong was assigned to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron\\xa07 (FASRON 7) at NAS San Diego (now known as NAS North Island). On November 27, 1950, he was assigned to VF-51, an all-jet squadron, becoming its youngest officer, and made his first flight in a jet, a Grumman F9F Panther, on January 5, 1951. He was promoted to ensign on June 5, 1951, and made his first jet carrier landing on USS\\xa0Essex two days later. On June 28, 1951, Essex had set sail for Korea, with VF-51 aboard to act as ground-attack aircraft. VF-51 flew ahead to Naval Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, where it conducted fighter-bomber training before rejoining the ship at the end of July.[27]\\n\\nOn August 29, 1951, Armstrong saw action in the Korean War as an escort for a photo reconnaissance plane over Songjin.[28] Five days later, on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. According to Armstrong, he was making a low bombing run at 350\\xa0mph (560\\xa0km/h) when 6 feet (1.8\\xa0m) of his wing was torn off after it collided with a cable that was strung across the hills as a booby trap. He was flying 500 feet (150\\xa0m) above the ground when he hit it. While there was heavy anti-aircraft fire in the area, none hit Armstrong\\'s aircraft.[29] An initial report to the commanding officer of Essex said that Armstrong\\'s F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. The report indicated he was trying to regain control and collided with a pole, which sliced off 2 feet (0.61\\xa0m) of the Panther\\'s right wing. Further perversions of the story by different authors added that he was only 20 feet (6.1\\xa0m) from the ground and that 3 feet (0.91\\xa0m) of his wing was sheared off.[30]\\n\\nArmstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but because of the loss of the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He intended to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, but his parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of his aircraft, F9F-2 BuNo 125122.[31]\\n\\nIn all, Armstrong flew 78\\xa0missions over Korea for a total of 121\\xa0hours in the air, a third of them in January 1952, with the final mission on March 5, 1952. Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War, 27 of them were from  Essex on this war cruise. Armstrong received the Air Medal for 20 combat missions, two gold stars for the next 40, the Korean Service Medal and Engagement Star, the National Defense Service Medal, and the United Nations Korea Medal.[32]\\n\\nArmstrong\\'s regular commission was terminated on February 25, 1952, and he became an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. On completion of his combat tour with Essex, he was assigned to a transport squadron, VR-32, in May 1952. He was released from active duty on August 23, 1952, but remained in the reserve, and was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on May 9, 1953.[33] As a reservist, he continued to fly, first with VF-724 at Naval Air Station Glenview in Illinois, and then, after moving to California, with VF-773 at Naval Air Station Los Alamitos.[34] He remained in the reserve for eight years before resigning his commission on October 21, 1960.[33]\\n\\nAfter his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue. His previously earned good but not outstanding grades now improved, lifting his final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and lived in its fraternity house. He wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue. The first was a version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, co-directed with his girlfriend Joanne Alford from the Alpha Chi Omega sorority, with songs from the 1937 Walt Disney film, including \"Someday My Prince Will Come\"; the second was titled The Land of Egelloc (\"college\" spelled backward), with music from Gilbert and Sullivan but new lyrics. \\n\\nArmstrong was chairman of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the club\\'s aircraft, an Aeronca and a couple of Pipers, which were kept at nearby Aretz Airport in Lafayette, Indiana. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, he damaged it in a rough landing in a farmer\\'s field, and it had to be hauled back to Lafayette on a trailer.[35] He was a baritone player in the Purdue All-American Marching Band.[36] Ten years later he was made an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi national band honorary fraternity.[37] Armstrong graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in January 1955.[34] In 1970, he completed his Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC).[38] He would eventually be awarded honorary doctorates by several universities.[39]\\n\\nArmstrong met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics, at a party hosted by Alpha Chi Omega.[40] According to the couple, there was no real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley, near Edwards AFB. Janet did not finish her degree, a fact she regretted later in life. The couple had three children.[41] In June 1961, their daughter Karen was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, a malignant tumor of the middle part of her brain stem.[42] X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk. She died of pneumonia, related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962, aged two.[43]\\n\\nFollowing his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base.[44] NACA had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Cleveland, where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955.[44] Armstrong\\'s stint at Cleveland lasted only a couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work there on July 11, 1955.[45]\\n\\nOn his first day, Armstrong was tasked with piloting chase planes during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, he was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress,[46] which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. He sat in the right-hand co-pilot seat while pilot in command, Stan Butchart sat in the left-hand pilot seat flying the B-29.[47]\\n\\nAs they climbed to 30,000 feet (9\\xa0km), the number-four engine stopped and the propeller began windmilling (rotating freely) in the airstream. Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller\\'s spinning, Butchart watched it slow, then resume spinning even faster than the others; if it spun too fast, it would break apart. Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of 210\\xa0mph (338\\xa0km/h) to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down attitude to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number-three engine, along with the number-one engine, because of the torque it created. They made a slow, circling descent from 30,000\\xa0ft (9\\xa0km) using only the number-two engine, and landed safely.[48]\\n\\nArmstrong served as project pilot on Century Series fighters, including the North American F-100 Super Sabre A and C variants, the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief and the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. He also flew the Douglas DC-3, Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, North American F-86 Sabre, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Boeing B-47 Stratojet and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the Paresev paraglider research vehicle program.[49] Over his career, he flew more than 200 different models of aircraft.[38] His first flight in a rocket-powered aircraft was on August 15, 1957, in the Bell X-1B, to an altitude of 11.4 miles (18.3\\xa0km). On landing, the poorly designed nose landing gear failed, as had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X-1B. He flew the North American X-15 seven times,[50] including the first flight with the Q-ball system, the first flight of the number\\xa03 X-15 airframe, and the first flight of the MH-96 adaptive flight control system.[51][52] He became an employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) when it was established on October 1, 1958, absorbing NACA.[53]\\n\\nArmstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. During his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, Armstrong was testing the MH-96 control system when he flew to a height of over 207,000 feet (63\\xa0km) (the highest he flew before Gemini 8). He held up the aircraft nose during its descent to demonstrate the MH-96\\'s g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around 140,000 feet (43\\xa0km). He flew past the landing field at Mach\\xa03 at over 100,000 feet (30\\xa0km) in altitude, and ended up 40 miles (64\\xa0km) south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he turned back toward the landing area, and landed. It was the longest X-15 flight in both flight time and length of the ground track.[54][55]\\n\\nFellow astronaut Michael Collins wrote that of the X-15 pilots Armstrong \"had been considered one of the weaker stick-and-rudder men, but the very best when it came to understanding the machine\\'s design and how it operated\".[56] Many of the test pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong\\'s engineering ability. Milt Thompson said he was \"the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots\". Bill Dana said Armstrong \"had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge\". Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion, especially people like Chuck Yeager and Pete Knight, who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew in a way that was \"more mechanical than it is flying\", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: Their flying skills did not come naturally.[57] Armstrong made seven flights in the X-15 between November 30, 1960, and July 26, 1962.[58] He reached a top speed of Mach 5.74 (3,989\\xa0mph, 6,420\\xa0km/h) in the X-15-1, and left the Flight Research Center with a total of 2,400 flying hours.[59]\\n\\nOn April 24, 1962, Armstrong flew for the only time with Yeager. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. As Armstrong told the story, Yeager never tried to talk him out of it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck, provoking Yeager to fits of laughter.[60]\\n\\nOn May 21, 1962, Armstrong was involved in the \"Nellis Affair\". He was sent in an F-104 to inspect Delamar Dry Lake in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing hydraulic fluid. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to Nellis Air Force Base, past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the tailhook to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.[61]\\n\\nIt took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33, but he almost landed long. The Nellis base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.[61]\\n\\nIn June 1958, Armstrong was selected for the U.S. Air Force\\'s Man in Space Soonest program, but the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) canceled its funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, it was superseded by Project Mercury, a civilian project run by NASA. As a NASA civilian test pilot, Armstrong was ineligible to become one of its astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots.[62][63] In November 1960, he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when it got off the design board.[64][65]\\n\\nIn April 1962, NASA sought applications for the second group of NASA astronauts for Project Gemini, a proposed two-man spacecraft. This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots.[66] Armstrong visited the Seattle World\\'s Fair in May 1962 and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After he returned from Seattle on June 4, he applied to become an astronaut. His application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed.[67] At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.[68]\\n\\nNASA\\'s Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked whether he would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of what the press dubbed \"the New Nine\"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the \"first civilian astronaut\".[69] Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;[70] the other was Elliot See, another former naval aviator.[71] NASA selected the second group that, compared with the Mercury Seven astronauts, were younger,[68] and had more impressive academic credentials.[72] Collins wrote that Armstrong was by far the most experienced test pilot in the Astronaut Corps.[56]\\n\\nOn February 8, 1965, Armstrong and Elliot See were picked as the backup crew for Gemini 5, with Armstrong as commander, supporting the prime crew of Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad.[73] The mission\\'s purpose was to practice space rendezvous and to develop procedures and equipment for a seven-day flight, all of which would be required for a mission to the Moon. With two other flights (Gemini 3 and Gemini 4) in preparation, six crews were competing for simulator time, so Gemini\\xa05 was postponed. It finally lifted off on August 21.[74] Armstrong and See watched the launch at Cape Kennedy, then flew to the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston.[75] The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous. Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target.[76]\\n\\nThe crews for Gemini\\xa08 were assigned on September 20, 1965. Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission became the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated David Scott as the pilot of Gemini\\xa08.[77][78] Scott was the first member of the third group of astronauts, who was selected on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment.[79] See was designated to command Gemini 9. Henceforth, each Gemini mission was commanded by a member of Armstrong\\'s group, with a member of Scott\\'s group as the pilot. Conrad would be Armstrong\\'s backup this time, and Richard F. Gordon Jr. his pilot.[77][78] Armstrong became the first American civilian in space. (Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union had become the first civilian—and first woman—nearly three years earlier aboard Vostok 6 when it launched on June 16, 1963.[80]) Armstrong would also be the last of his group to fly in space, as See died in a T-38 crash on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate Charles Bassett. They were replaced by the backup crew of Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan, while Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin moved up from the backup crew of Gemini 10 to become the backup for Gemini 9,[81] and would eventually fly Gemini 12.[82]\\n\\nGemini 8 launched on March 16, 1966. It was the most complex mission yet, with a rendezvous and docking with an uncrewed Agena target vehicle, and the planned second American spacewalk (EVA) by Scott. The mission was planned to last 75\\xa0hours and 55\\xa0orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10:00:00 EST,[83] the Titan II rocket carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02 EST, putting them into an orbit from which they chased the Agena.[84] They achieved the first-ever docking between two spacecraft.[85] Contact with the crew was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. While out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Gemini\\'s Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS). Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but the roll increased dramatically until they were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with Gemini\\'s attitude control. Armstrong engaged the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turned off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft had to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring caused one of the thrusters to stick in the on position.[86]\\n\\nA few people in the Astronaut Office, including Walter Cunningham, felt that Armstrong and Scott \"had botched their first mission\".[87] There was speculation that Armstrong could have salvaged the mission if he had turned on only one of the two RCS rings, saving the other for mission objectives. These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures had been written, and it was possible to turn on only both RCS rings, not one or the other.[88] Gene Kranz wrote, \"The crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong.\" The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft were docked, they must be considered one spacecraft. Kranz considered this the mission\\'s most important lesson.[89] Armstrong was depressed that the mission was cut short,[90] canceling most mission objectives and robbing Scott of his EVA. The Agena was later reused as a docking target by Gemini 10.[91] Armstrong and Scott received the NASA Exceptional Service Medal,[92][93] and the Air Force awarded Scott the Distinguished Flying Cross as well.[94] Scott was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Armstrong received a $678 raise in pay to $21,653 a year (equivalent to $209,845 in 2024), making him NASA\\'s highest-paid astronaut.[90]\\n\\nIn Armstrong\\'s final assignment in the Gemini program, he was the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup pilot, William Anders.[95] The launch was on September 12, 1966,[96] with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM).[97]\\n\\nFollowing the flight, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24-day goodwill tour of South America.[98] Also on the tour, which took in 11\\xa0countries and 14\\xa0major cities, were Dick Gordon, George Low, their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong greeted dignitaries in their local language, Guarani; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont.[99]\\n\\nOn January 27, 1967—the day of the Apollo 1 fire—Armstrong was in Washington, D.C., with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and Scott Carpenter for the signing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the MSC. During these calls, they learned of the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee in the fire. Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.[100]\\n\\nOn April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo\\xa01 investigation released its final report, Armstrong and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\"[101] According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.[102]\\n\\nThe crew was officially assigned on November 20, 1967.[103] For crewmates, Armstrong was assigned Lovell and Aldrin, from Gemini 12. After design and manufacturing delays of the lunar module (LM), Apollo 8 and\\xa09 swapped prime and backup crews. Based on the normal crew rotation, Armstrong would command Apollo 11,[102] with one change: Collins on the Apollo\\xa08 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.[104] Lovell took his place on the Apollo\\xa08 crew, and, when Collins recovered, he joined Armstrong\\'s crew.[105]\\n\\nTo give the astronauts practice piloting the LM on its descent, NASA commissioned Bell Aircraft to build two Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the \"Flying Bedsteads\", they simulated the Moon\\'s one-sixth gravity using a turbofan engine to support five-sixths of the craft\\'s weight. On May 6, 1968, 100 feet (30\\xa0m) above the ground, Armstrong\\'s controls started to degrade and the LLRV began rolling.[106] He ejected safely before the vehicle struck the ground and burst into flames. Later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time. His only injury was from biting his tongue. The LLRV was completely destroyed.[107] Even though he was nearly killed, Armstrong maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as they gave commanders essential experience in piloting the lunar landing craft.[108]\\n\\nIn addition to the LLRV training, NASA began lunar landing simulator training after Apollo 10 was completed. Aldrin and Armstrong trained for a variety of scenarios that could develop during a real lunar landing.[109] They also received briefings from geologists at NASA.[110]\\n\\nAfter Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo\\xa08, Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo\\xa08 orbited the Moon.[111] According to Armstrong\\'s 2005 biography, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Commander Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the lunar module pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number\\xa03 position of the crew.[112] The crew of Apollo 11 was assigned on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders, and Fred Haise as the backup crew.[113]\\n\\nAccording to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong\\'s being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[114][115] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\\xa0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[116]\\n\\nA Saturn V rocket launched Apollo 11 from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 UTC (09:32:00 EDT local time).[117] Armstrong\\'s wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the Banana River.[118] During the launch, Armstrong\\'s heart rate peaked at 110\\xa0beats per minute.[119] He found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini\\xa08 Titan II launch. The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics.[120]\\n\\nApollo 11\\'s objective was to land safely on the Moon, rather than to touch down at a precise location. Three minutes into the lunar descent, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Lunar Module Eagle would probably touch down several miles (kilometres) beyond the planned landing zone.[121] As the Eagle\\'s landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms sounded. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin knew what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by executive overflows in the lunar module guidance computer. In 2007, Aldrin said the overflows were caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, causing the computer to process unnecessary radar data. When it did not have enough time to execute all tasks, the computer dropped the lower-priority ones, triggering the alarms. Aldrin said he decided to leave the radar on in case an abort was necessary when re-docking with the Apollo command module; he did not realize it would cause the processing overflows.[122]\\n\\nWhen Armstrong noticed they were heading toward a landing area that seemed unsafe, he took manual control of the LM and attempted to find a safer area. This took longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken.[123] For this reason, Mission Control was concerned that the LM was running low on fuel.[124] On landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had 40\\xa0seconds of fuel left, including the 20\\xa0seconds\\' worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort.[125] During training, Armstrong had, on several occasions, landed with fewer than 15\\xa0seconds of fuel; he was also confident the LM could survive a fall of up to 50 feet (15\\xa0m). Post-mission analysis showed that at touchdown there were 45 to 50\\xa0seconds of propellant burn time left.[126]\\n\\nThe landing on the surface of the Moon occurred several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969.[127] One of three 67-inch (170\\xa0cm) probes attached to three of the LM\\'s four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light in the LM illuminated, and Aldrin called out, \"Contact light.\" Armstrong shut the engine off and said, \"Shutdown.\" As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, \"Okay, engine stop\"; then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a 10-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, \"We copy you down, Eagle.\" Armstrong confirmed the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\" Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back. They then returned to the checklist of contingency tasks, should an emergency liftoff become necessary.[128][129][130] After Armstrong confirmed touch down, Duke re-acknowledged, adding a comment about the flight crew\\'s relief: \"Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We\\'re breathing again. Thanks a lot.\"[125] During the landing, Armstrong\\'s heart rate ranged from 100 to 150\\xa0beats per minute.[131]\\n\\nThe flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the module, but Armstrong asked for this to be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder.[132] At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a Lunar Module landing pad, Armstrong said, \"I\\'m going to step off the LM now\". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 UTC July 21, 1969,[133] then said, \"That\\'s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[134] The exact time of Armstrong\\'s first step on the Moon is unclear.[135]\\n\\nArmstrong prepared his famous epigram on his own.[136] In a post-flight press conference, he said that he chose the words \"just prior to leaving the LM.\"[137] In a 1983 interview in Esquire magazine, he explained to George Plimpton: \"I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touch down on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty\\xa0... Most people don\\'t realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn\\'t seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we\\'d have to abort landing.\"[136] In 2012, his brother Dean Armstrong said that Neil showed him a draft of the line months before the launch.[138] Historian Andrew Chaikin, who interviewed Armstrong in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that Armstrong claimed to have conceived the line during the mission.[139]\\n\\nRecordings of Armstrong\\'s transmission do not provide evidence for the indefinite article \"a\" before \"man\", though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static obscured it. Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to recordings, he eventually conceded he must have dropped the \"a\".[134] He later said he \"would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended, even if it was not said—although it might actually have been\".[140] There have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing \"a\";[134][141] Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer, conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did say \"a man\", but the \"a\" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time.[134][142][143] Ford and James R. Hansen, Armstrong\\'s authorized biographer, presented these findings to Armstrong and NASA representatives, who conducted their own analysis.[144] Armstrong found Ford\\'s analysis \"persuasive\".[145][146] Linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman wrote of their skepticism of Ford\\'s claims on the blog Language Log.[147] A 2016 peer-reviewed study again concluded Armstrong had included the article.[148] NASA\\'s transcript continues to show the \"a\" in parentheses.[149]\\n\\nWhen Armstrong made his proclamation, Voice of America was rebroadcast live by the BBC and many other stations worldwide. An estimated 530\\xa0million people viewed the event,[150] 20 percent out of a world population of approximately 3.6\\xa0billion.[151][152]\\xa0\\n\\nQ: Did you misspeak?\\n\\nA: There isn\\'t any way of knowing.\\n\\nQ: Several sources say you did.\\n\\nA: I mean, there isn\\'t any way of my knowing. When I listen to the tape, I can\\'t hear the \\'a\\', but that doesn\\'t mean it wasn\\'t there, because that was the fastest VOX ever built. There was no mike-switch — it was a voice-operated key or VOX. In a helmet you find you lose a lot of syllables. Sometimes a short syllable like \\'a\\' might not be transmitted. However, when I listen to it, I can\\'t hear it. But the \\'a\\' is implied, so I\\'m happy if they just put it in parentheses.\\n\\nAbout 19\\xa0minutes after Armstrong\\'s first step, Aldrin joined him on the surface, becoming the second human to walk on the Moon. They began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating the flight, and with Aldrin, planted the flag of the United States. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole,[153] it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontally.[154] However, the rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze.[155] Shortly after the flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by telephone from his office. He spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.[156] In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. The mission was planned to the minute, with the majority of photographic tasks performed by Armstrong with the single Hasselblad camera.[157]\\n\\nAfter helping to set up the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package, Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater, 65 yards (59\\xa0m) east of the LM, the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission. His final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov, and Apollo\\xa01 astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee.[158] The Apollo 11 EVA lasted two and a half hours.[159] Each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer EVA period; the crew of Apollo 17 spent over 22\\xa0hours exploring the lunar surface.[159] In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited their Moon walk because they were unsure how the space suits would cope with the Moon\\'s extremely high temperature.[160]\\n\\nAfter they re-entered the LM, the hatch was closed and sealed. While preparing for liftoff, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky space suits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed in the circuit breaker to start the launch sequence.[161] The Eagle then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with Columbia, the command and service module. The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, to be picked up by the USS\\xa0Hornet.[162]\\n\\n\\nAfter being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew was feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour.[163] \\nThe tour began on August 13, when the three astronauts spoke and rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[164][165] On the same evening an official state dinner was held in Los Angeles to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44\\xa0governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83\\xa0nations. President Nixon and Vice President Agnew presented each astronaut with a Presidential Medal of Freedom.[164][166]\\n\\nAfter the tour Armstrong took part in Bob Hope\\'s 1969 USO show, primarily to Vietnam.[167] In May 1970, Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research; after arriving in Leningrad from Poland, he traveled to Moscow where he met Premier Alexei Kosygin. Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 and was given a tour of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, which he described as \"a bit Victorian in nature\".[168] At the end of the day, he was surprised to view a delayed video of the launch of Soyuz 9 as it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place, even though Valentina Tereshkova had been his host and her husband, Andriyan Nikolayev, was on board.[169]\\n\\nShortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong stated that he did not plan to fly in space again.[170] He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA, served in the position for a year, then resigned from it and NASA in 1971.[171] He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati,[172] having chosen Cincinnati over other universities, including his alma mater Purdue, because Cincinnati had a small aerospace department,[173] and said he hoped the faculty there would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only a USC master\\'s degree.[174] He began his master\\'s degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight.[175]\\n\\nAt Cincinnati, Armstrong was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He took a heavy teaching load, taught core classes, and created two graduate-level classes: aircraft design and experimental flight mechanics. He was considered a good teacher, and a tough grader. His research activities during this time did not involve his work at NASA, as he did not want to give the appearance of favoritism; he later regretted the decision. After teaching for eight years, Armstrong resigned in 1980. When the university changed from an independent municipal university to a state school, bureaucracy increased. He did not want to be a part of the faculty collective bargaining group, so he decided to teach half-time. According to Armstrong, he had the same amount of work but received half his salary. In 1979, less than 10% of his income came from his university salary. Employees at the university did not know why he left.[175]\\n\\nIn 1970, after an explosion aboard Apollo 13 aborted its lunar landing, Armstrong was part of Edgar Cortright\\'s investigation of the mission. He produced a detailed chronology of the flight. He determined that a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version, led to the explosion. Cortright\\'s report recommended the entire tank be redesigned at a cost of $40\\xa0million. Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, opposed the recommendation, since only the thermostat switch had caused the problem. They lost the argument, and the tanks were redesigned.[176]\\n\\nIn 1986, President Ronald Reagan asked Armstrong to join the Rogers Commission investigating the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Armstrong was made vice chairman of the commission and held private interviews with contacts he had developed over the years to help determine the cause of the disaster. He helped limit the committee\\'s recommendations to nine, believing that if there were too many, NASA would not act on them.[177]\\n\\nArmstrong was appointed to a fourteen-member commission by President Reagan to develop a plan for American civilian spaceflight in the 21st century. The commission was chaired by former NASA administrator Dr. Thomas O. Paine, with whom Armstrong had worked during the Apollo program. The group published a book titled Pioneering the Space Frontier: The Report on the National Commission on Space, recommending a permanent lunar base by 2006, and sending people to Mars by 2015. The recommendations were largely ignored, overshadowed by the Challenger disaster.[178]\\n\\nArmstrong and his wife attended the memorial service for the victims of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, at the invitation of President George W. Bush.[179]\\n\\nAfter Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was Chrysler, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America.[180] He acted as a spokesman for only American companies.[181]\\n\\nIn addition to his duties as a spokesman, he also served on the board of directors of several companies. The first company board Armstrong joined was Gates Learjet, chairing their technical committee. He flew their new and experimental jets and even set a climb and altitude record for business jets. Armstrong became a member of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company\\'s board in 1973. They were interested in nuclear power and wanted to increase the company\\'s technical competence. He served on the board of Taft Broadcasting, also based in Cincinnati. Armstrong joined the board of solid rocket booster Thiokol in 1989, after previously serving on the Rogers Commission which found that the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed due to a defect in the Thiokol-manufactured solid rocket boosters. When Armstrong left the University of Cincinnati, he became the chairman of Cardwell International Ltd., a company that manufactured drilling rigs. He served on additional aerospace boards, first United Airlines in 1978, and later Eaton Corporation in 1980. He was asked to chair the board of directors for a subsidiary of Eaton, AIL Systems. He chaired the board through the company\\'s 2000 merger with EDO Corporation, until his retirement in 2002.[182][183]\\n\\nIn 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the \"greatest explorers\" to the North Pole. The group included Armstrong, Edmund Hillary, Hillary\\'s son Peter, Steve Fossett, and Patrick Morrow. They arrived at the Pole on April 6, 1985. He did not inform the media of the trip, preferring to keep it private.[184]\\n\\nArmstrong\\'s family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\".[185][186][187] He kept a low profile later in his life, leading to the belief that he was a recluse.[188][189] Recalling Armstrong\\'s humility, John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, told CNN: \"[Armstrong] didn\\'t feel that he should be out huckstering himself. He was a humble person, and that\\'s the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before.\"[190] Armstrong turned down most requests for interviews and public appearances. Michael Collins said in his book Carrying the Fire that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor, it was like he \"retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge\". Armstrong found this amusing, and said, \"...\\xa0those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems.\"[191]\\n\\nAndrew Chaikin says in A Man on the Moon that Armstrong kept a low profile but was not a recluse, citing his participation in interviews, advertisements for Chrysler, and hosting a cable television series.[192] Between 1991 and 1993, he hosted First Flights with Neil Armstrong, an aviation history documentary series on A&E.[191] In 2010, Armstrong voiced the character of Dr. Jack Morrow in Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey,[193] an animated educational sci-fi adventure film initiated by JPL/NASA through a grant from Jet Propulsion Lab.[194]\\n\\nArmstrong guarded the use of his name, image, and famous quote. When it was launched in 1981, MTV wanted to use his quote in its station identification, with the American flag replaced with the MTV logo, but he refused the use of his voice and likeness.[195] He sued Hallmark Cards in 1994, when they used his name, and a recording of the \"one small step\" quote, in a Christmas ornament without his permission. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which Armstrong donated to Purdue.[196][197]\\n\\nFor many years, he wrote letters congratulating new Eagle Scouts on their accomplishment, but decided to quit the practice in the 1990s because he felt the letters should be written by people who knew the scout. (In 2003, he received 950\\xa0congratulation requests.) This contributed to the myth of his reclusiveness.[198] Armstrong used to autograph everything except first day covers. Around 1993, he found out his signatures were being sold online, and that most of them were forgeries, and stopped giving autographs.[189]\\n\\nSome former astronauts, including Glenn and Apollo 17\\'s Harrison Schmitt, sought political careers after leaving NASA. Armstrong was approached by groups from both the Democratic and Republican parties but declined the offers. He supported states\\' rights and opposed the U.S. acting as the \"world\\'s policeman\".[199]\\n\\nWhen Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop in the late 1950s, he gave his religious affiliation as \"deist\".[200] His mother later said that his religious views caused her grief and distress in later life, as she was a Christian.[201] Upon his return from the Moon, Armstrong gave a speech in front of the U.S. Congress in which he thanked them for giving him the opportunity to see some of the \"grandest views of the Creator\".[202][203] In the early 1980s, he was the subject of a hoax claiming that he converted to Islam after hearing the call to prayer while walking on the Moon. Indonesian singer Suhaemi wrote a song called \"Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan\" (\"The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon\") which described Armstrong\\'s supposed conversion, and the song was widely discussed by Jakarta news outlets in 1983.[204] Similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia. In March 1983, the U.S. State Department responded by issuing a message to embassies and consulates in Muslim countries saying that Armstrong had not converted to Islam.[205] The hoax surfaced occasionally for the next three decades. Part of the confusion arose from the similarity between the names of the country of Lebanon, which has a majority Muslim population, and Armstrong\\'s longtime residence in Lebanon, Ohio.[205]\\n\\nIn 1972, Armstrong visited the Scottish town of Langholm, the traditional seat of Clan Armstrong. He was made the first freeman of the burgh, and happily declared the town his home.[206] To entertain the crowd, the Justice of the Peace read from an unrepealed archaic 400-year-old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town.[207]\\n\\nArmstrong flew light aircraft for pleasure. He enjoyed gliders and before the Moon flight had earned a gold badge with two diamonds from the International Gliding Commission. He continued to fly engineless aircraft well into his 70s.[208]\\n\\nWhile working on his farm in November 1978, Armstrong jumped off the back of his grain truck and caught his wedding ring in its wheel, tearing the tip off his left ring finger. He collected the severed tip, packed it in ice, and had surgeons reattach it at a nearby hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.[209] In February 1991, he suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at Aspen, Colorado.[210]\\n\\nArmstrong and his first wife, Janet, separated in 1990 and divorced in 1994 after 38 years of marriage.[211][212] He met his second wife, Carol Held Knight, at a golf tournament in 1992, when they were seated together at breakfast. She said little to Armstrong, but he called her two weeks later to ask what she was doing. She replied that she was cutting down a cherry tree, and he arrived at her house 35 minutes later to help. They were married in Ohio on June 12, 1994, and had a second ceremony at San Ysidro Ranch in California. They lived in Indian Hill, Ohio.[213][214] Through his marriage to Carol, he was the father-in-law of future New York Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen.\\n\\nIn May 2005, Armstrong became involved in a legal dispute with Mark Sizemore, his barber of 20\\xa0years. After cutting Armstrong\\'s hair, Sizemore sold some of it to a collector for $3,000 without Armstrong\\'s knowledge or permission.[215] Armstrong threatened legal action against Sizemore unless he returned the hair or donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong\\'s choosing. Sizemore, unable to retrieve the hair, donated the proceeds to charity.[216][217]\\n\\nOn August 7, 2012, Armstrong underwent bypass surgery at Mercy Faith–Fairfield Hospital in Fairfield, Ohio, to relieve coronary artery disease.[218][219] Although he was reportedly recovering well,[220] he developed complications and died on August 25.[221][222] President Barack Obama issued a statement memorializing Armstrong as \"among the greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time\",[223][224] and added that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States\\' citizens and had delivered \"a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\"[225]\\n\\nArmstrong\\'s family released a statement describing him as a \"reluctant American hero [who had] served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut\\xa0... While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\"[226]\\n\\nBuzz Aldrin called Armstrong \"a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew\", and said he was disappointed that they would not be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing together in 2019.[227][228] Michael Collins said, \"He was the best, and I will miss him terribly.\"[229][230] NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said, \"As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind\\'s first small step on a world beyond our own\".[231][232]\\n\\nA tribute was held for Armstrong on September 13, at Washington National Cathedral, whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of Moon rock amid its stained-glass panels.[233] In attendance were Armstrong\\'s Apollo 11 crewmates, Collins and Aldrin; Gene Cernan, the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man to walk on the Moon; and former senator and astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. In his eulogy, Charles Bolden praised Armstrong\\'s \"courage, grace, and humility\". Cernan recalled Armstrong\\'s low-fuel approach to the Moon: \"When the gauge says empty, we all know there\\'s a gallon or two left in the tank!\" Diana Krall sang the song \"Fly Me to the Moon\". Collins led prayers. David Scott spoke, possibly for the first time, about an incident during their Gemini\\xa08 mission: minutes before the hatch was to be sealed, a small chip of dried glue fell into the latch of his harness and prevented it from being buckled, threatening to abort the mission. Armstrong then called on Conrad to solve the problem, which he did, and the mission proceeded. \"That happened because Neil Armstrong was a team player—he always worked on behalf of the team.\"[233] Congressman Bill Johnson from Armstrong\\'s home state of Ohio led calls for President Barack Obama to authorize a state funeral in Washington D.C. Throughout his lifetime, Armstrong shunned publicity and rarely gave interviews. Mindful that Armstrong would have objected to a state funeral, his family opted to have a private funeral in Cincinnati.[234] On September 14, Armstrong\\'s cremated remains were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean from the USS\\xa0Philippine Sea.[235] Flags were flown at half-staff on the day of Armstrong\\'s funeral.[236]\\n\\nIn July 2019, after observations of the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing, The New York Times reported on details of a medical malpractice suit Armstrong\\'s family had filed against Mercy Health–Fairfield Hospital, where he died. When Armstrong appeared to be recovering from his bypass surgery, nurses removed the wires connected to his temporary pacemaker. He began to bleed internally and his blood pressure dropped. Doctors took him to the hospital\\'s catheterization laboratory, and only later began operating. Two of the three physicians who reviewed the medical files during the lawsuit called this a serious error, saying surgery should have begun immediately; experts the Times talked to, while qualifying their judgement by noting that they were unable to review the specific records in the case, said that taking a patient directly to the operating room under those circumstances generally gave them the highest chance of survival.[218]\\n\\nThe family ultimately settled for $6\\xa0million in 2014. Letters included with the 93\\xa0pages of documents sent to the Times by an unknown person[237] show that his sons intimated to the hospital, through their lawyers, that they might discuss what happened to their father publicly at the 45th anniversary observances in 2014. The hospital, fearing the bad publicity that would result from being accused of negligently causing the death of a revered figure such as Armstrong, agreed to pay as long as the family never spoke about the suit or the settlement.[218] Armstrong\\'s wife, Carol, was not a party to the lawsuit. She reportedly felt that her husband would have been opposed to taking legal action.[238]\\n\\nWhen Pete Conrad of Apollo 12 became the third man to walk on the Moon, on November 19, 1969, his first words referenced Armstrong. The shorter of the two, when Conrad stepped from the LM onto the surface he proclaimed \"Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that\\'s a long one for me.\"[239]\\n\\nArmstrong received many honors and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (with distinction) from President Nixon,[164][240] the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society,[241] and the Collier Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association (1969);[242] the NASA Distinguished Service Medal[243] and the Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy (1970);[244] the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy (1971);[245] the Congressional Space Medal of Honor from President Jimmy Carter (1978);[92] the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association (2001);[246] and a Congressional Gold Medal (2011).[247]\\n\\nArmstrong was elected as member into the National Academy of Engineering in 1978 for contributions to aerospace engineering, scientific knowledge, and exploration of the universe as an experimental test pilot and astronaut.[248] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2001.[249]\\n\\nArmstrong and his Apollo 11 crewmates were the 1999 recipients of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.[250] On April 18, 2006, he received NASA\\'s Ambassador of Exploration Award.[251] The Space Foundation named Armstrong as a recipient of its 2013 General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.[252] Armstrong was also inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor,[253][254] the International Space Hall of Fame,[255] National Aviation Hall of Fame, and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame.[256][257] He was awarded his Naval Astronaut badge in a ceremony on board the aircraft carrier USS\\xa0Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 10, 2010, in a ceremony attended by Lovell and Cernan.[258]\\n\\nThe lunar crater Armstrong, 31 miles (50\\xa0km) from the Apollo 11 landing site, and asteroid 6469 Armstrong are named in his honor.[259] There are more than a dozen elementary, middle and high schools named for Armstrong in the United States,[260] and many places around the world have streets, buildings, schools, and other places named for him or Apollo.[261] The Armstrong Air and Space Museum, in Armstrong\\'s hometown of Wapakoneta,[262] and the Neil Armstrong Airport in New Knoxville, Ohio, are named after him.[263] The mineral armstrongite is named after him,[264] and the mineral armalcolite is named, in part, after him.[265]\\n\\nIn October 2004 Purdue University named its new engineering building Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering;[266] the building was dedicated on October 27, 2007, during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue astronauts.[267] The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center was renamed the NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2014.[268] In September 2012, the U.S. Navy named the first Armstrong-class vessel RV\\xa0Neil Armstrong. Delivered to the Navy on September 23, 2015, it is a modern oceanographic research platform supporting a wide range of activities by academic groups.[269] In 2019, the College of Engineering at Purdue University celebrated the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong\\'s walk on the Moon by launching the Neil Armstrong Distinguished Visiting Fellows Program, which brings highly accomplished scholars and practitioners to the college to catalyze collaborations with faculty and students.[270]\\n\\nArmstrong\\'s authorized biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, was published in 2005. For many years, he turned down biography offers from authors such as Stephen Ambrose and James A. Michener but agreed to work with James R. Hansen after reading one of Hansen\\'s other biographies.[271] He recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50% chance of landing on the Moon. \"I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful\".[272] A film adaptation of the book, starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Damien Chazelle, was released in October 2018.[273]\\n\\nIn July 2018, Armstrong\\'s sons put his collection of memorabilia up for sale, including his Boy Scout cap, and various flags and medals flown on his space missions. A series of auctions held November 1–3, 2018, realized $5,276,320 (~$6.31\\xa0million in 2023). As of July 2019[update], the auction sales totaled $16.7\\xa0million.[238] Two fragments of wood from the propeller and four pieces of fabric from the wing of the 1903 Wright Flyer that Armstrong took to the Moon fetched between $112,500 and $275,000 each.[274][275] Armstrong\\'s gold medal that flew aboard the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon with him was sold for $2,055,000 by Heritage Auctions.[276] Armstrong\\'s wife, Carol, has not put any of his memorabilia up for sale.[238]\\n\\nArmstrong donated his papers to Purdue. Along with posthumous donations by his widow Carol, the collection consists of over 450\\xa0boxes of material. In May 2019, she donated two 25-by-24-inch (640 by 610\\xa0mm) pieces of fabric from the Wright Flyer, along with his correspondence related to them.[277]\\n\\nIn a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Armstrong was ranked as the number-one most popular space hero;[278] and in 2013, Flying magazine ranked him number one on its list of 51 Heroes of Aviation.[279] The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight. In 2005, he said that a human mission to Mars would be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s. In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the Ares I launch vehicle and the Constellation Moon landing program.[280] In an open letter also signed by fellow Apollo veterans Lovell and Cernan, he said, \"For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature\".[281] On November 18, 2010, aged 80, he said in a speech during the Science & Technology Summit in the Hague, Netherlands, that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked.[282]\\n\\nThe planetarium at Altoona Area High School in Altoona, Pennsylvania is named after Armstrong and is home to a Space Race museum.[283] A campsite in Camp Sandy Beach at Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Rockville, Rhode Island, is named in his honor, a nod to his Scouting career.\\n\\nArmstrong was named the class exemplar for the Class of 2019 at the U.S. Air Force Academy.[284]\\n\".'}\n"

See notes and footnotes.\\n Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio[1] (/diˈkæprioʊ, dɪ-/ ⓘ; Italian: [diˈkaːprjo]; born November 11, 1974) is an American actor and film producer. Known for his work in biographical and period films, he is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and three Golden Globe Awards. As of 2019,[update] his films have grossed over $7.2\\xa0billion worldwide, and he has been placed eight times in annual rankings of the world\\'s highest-paid actors.\\n\\nBorn in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials. He had a recurring role in the sitcom Parenthood (1990–1991), and had his first major film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy\\'s Life (1993). He received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award nomination for playing a developmentally disabled boy in What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). DiCaprio achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). After the latter became the highest-grossing film in the world at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including the 2002 crime dramas Catch Me If You Can and Gangs of New York; the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.\\n\\nDiCaprio continued to gain acclaim for his performances in the biopic The Aviator (2004), the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006) and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008). He later made environmental documentaries and starred in several high-profile directors\\' successful projects, including the action thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015)—for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor—the comedy-dramas Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) and Don\\'t Look Up (2021), and the crime drama Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).\\n\\nDiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions—a production company that has made some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010)—and Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. A United Nations Messenger of Peace, he regularly supports charitable causes. In 2005, he was named a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he appeared in Time magazine\\'s 100 most influential people in the world. DiCaprio was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a 2022 readers\\' poll by Empire.\\n\\nDiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California.[2] He is the only child of Irmelin Indenbirken, a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and distributor. They met while attending college and moved to Los Angeles after graduating.[3][4] Irmelin is German, and George is of Italian and German descent.[5] George\\'s parents, Salvatore Di Caprio and Rosina Cassella, were Italian;[6][7][8] Irmelin\\'s father, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German,[9] while her mother, Helene Indenbirken, was a Russian immigrant living in Germany.[10] Sources have falsely claimed that DiCaprio\\'s maternal grandmother was born in Odesa, Ukraine; there is no evidence that he has any relatives of Ukrainian birth or heritage.[11]\\n\\nDiCaprio\\'s parents named him Leonardo because his pregnant mother first felt him kick while she was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy.[12] When he was one year old, DiCaprio\\'s parents divorced after George fell in love with another woman and moved out.[13][14] To raise him together, DiCaprio\\'s parents moved into twin cottages with a shared garden in Echo Park, Los Angeles.[13][15] George lived with his girlfriend and her son, Adam Farrar, with whom DiCaprio developed a close bond.[16] DiCaprio and his mother later moved to other neighborhoods, such as Los Feliz.[17] He has described his parents as \"bohemian in every sense of the word\" and as \"the people I trust the most in the world\".[18] DiCaprio has mentioned growing up poor in a neighborhood plagued with prostitution, crime and violence.[19] He was raised Catholic.[20]\\n\\nAttending the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years and later Seeds Elementary School, he later enrolled at John Marshall High School.[21][22] DiCaprio disliked public school and wanted to audition for acting jobs instead.[19] He dropped out of high school later, eventually earning a general equivalency diploma.[23]\\n\\nAs a child, DiCaprio wanted to become either a marine biologist or an actor. He eventually favored the latter; he liked impersonating characters and imitating people, and enjoyed seeing their reactions to his acting.[24] According to DiCaprio, his interest in performing began at the age of two when he went onto the stage at a performance festival and danced spontaneously to a positive response from the crowd.[25] He was also motivated to learn acting when Farrar\\'s appearance in a television commercial earned him $50,000.[26] DiCaprio has said in interviews that his first television appearance was in the children\\'s series Romper Room, and that he was dismissed from the show for being disruptive. The show\\'s host has denied that any children were removed from the show in this way.[27][28] When he was 11, he almost quit acting in order to pursue breakdancing, having gotten second place in a competition in his mother\\'s native Germany.[29] At 14, he began appearing in several commercials for Matchbox cars, which he calls his first role.[27] DiCaprio later appeared in commercials for Kraft Singles, Bubble Yum and Apple Jacks.[30] In 1989, he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show The New Lassie.[31]\\n\\nAt the beginning of his career, DiCaprio had difficulty finding an agent. When he found one, the agent suggested DiCaprio change his name to Lenny Williams to appeal to American audiences, which he declined to do.[32] DiCaprio remained jobless for a year and a half, although he had 100\\xa0auditions. Following this lack of success, DiCaprio was going to give up acting but his father persuaded him to persevere. Motivated by his father and by the prospect of financial security, he continued to audition. After a talent agent, who knew his mother\\'s friend, recommended him to casting directors, DiCaprio secured roles in about 20\\xa0commercials.[33]\\n\\nBy the early\\xa01990s, DiCaprio began acting regularly on television, starting with a role in the pilot of The Outsiders (1990) and one episode of the soap opera Santa Barbara (1990), in which he played a teenage alcoholic.[34] DiCaprio\\'s career prospects improved when he was cast in Parenthood, a series based on the 1989 comedy film of the same name. To prepare for the role of Garry Buckman, a troubled teenager, he analyzed Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance in the original film.[35] His work that year earned him two nominations at the 12th Youth in Film Awards—Best Young Actor in a Daytime Series for Santa Barbara and Best Young Actor Starring in a New Television Series for Parenthood.[36] Around this time, he was a contestant on the children\\'s game show Fun House, on which he performed several stunts, including catching the fish inside a small pool using only his teeth.[37][38]\\n\\nDiCaprio made his film debut in 1991 as the stepson of an unscrupulous landlord in the low-budget horror sequel Critters 3—a part he later described as \"your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair\".[39] DiCaprio has stated that he prefers not to remember Critters 3, viewing it as \"possibly one of the worst films of all time\" and the kind of role he wanted to avoid in the future.[40] Later in 1991, he became a recurring cast member on the sitcom Growing Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the show\\'s central family.[41] Co-star Joanna Kerns recalls DiCaprio being \"especially intelligent and disarming for his age\" but she noted that he was also mischievous and jocular on set, and often made fun of his co-stars.[42] DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to young female audience, but his arrival did not improve the show\\'s ratings and he left before the end of its run.[43] He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Television Series.[44] DiCaprio also had an uncredited role in 1991 in one episode of Roseanne.[45]\\n\\nIn 1992, DiCaprio had a brief role in the first installment of the Poison Ivy film series,[46] and was handpicked by Robert De Niro from a shortlist of 400 young actors to co-star with him in This Boy\\'s Life. Adapted from the memoir by Tobias Wolff, the film focuses on the relationship between a rebellious teenager, Toby (DiCaprio), and his mother (Ellen Barkin) and abusive stepfather (De Niro).[27][47][48] Director Michael Caton-Jones said that DiCaprio did not know how to behave on set; accordingly, Caton-Jones used a strict mentoring style, after which DiCaprio\\'s behavior began to improve.[42] Bilge Ebiri of Rolling Stone found that the powerful bond between Barkin and DiCaprio elevated the film, praising DiCaprio\\'s portrayal of his character\\'s complex growth from a rebellious teen to an independent young man.[46] This Boy\\'s Life was the first film that gained him recognition.[49]\\n\\nDiCaprio played the developmentally disabled brother of Johnny Depp\\'s character in What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), a comedy-drama about a dysfunctional Iowa family. Caton-Jones recommended DiCaprio to director Lasse Hallström who was initially skeptical, as he considered DiCaprio too good-looking for the part. Hallström cast DiCaprio after he emerged as \"the most observant\" auditionee.[39][42] To ensure authenticity in his portrayal, DiCaprio studied similarly impaired children and their mannerisms, and Hallström allowed him to create the character using his own researched attributes.[50] The film became a critical success.[51] At 19, DiCaprio earned a National Board of Review Award, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, making him the seventh-youngest Oscar nominee in the category.[52][53] \"The film\\'s real show-stopping turn comes from Mr. DiCaprio,\" wrote The New York Times critic Janet Maslin, \"who makes Arnie\\'s many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. The performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end.\"[54] Caryn James, also writing for The New York Times, said of his performances in This Boy\\'s Life and What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape: \"He made the raw, emotional neediness of those boys completely natural and powerful.\"[55]\\n\\nDiCaprio\\'s first role of 1995 was in Sam Raimi\\'s Western The Quick and the Dead. When Sony Pictures became dubious over DiCaprio\\'s casting, co-star Sharon Stone paid his salary herself.[56] The film was released to dismal box office performance and mixed reviews from critics.[57][58] DiCaprio next starred as a teenage Jim Carroll, a drug-addicted high school basketball player and budding writer, in the biopic The Basketball Diaries.[59] He starred in the erotic drama Total Eclipse (1995), driven by the desire to showcase an exceptional performance, which would focus on his acting talent rather than his much-discussed physical appeal.[60] Directed by Agnieszka Holland, it is a fictionalized account of the same-sex relationship between Arthur Rimbaud (DiCaprio) and Paul Verlaine (David Thewlis). DiCaprio was cast when River Phoenix died before filming began.[13] Although the film failed commercially,[61] it has been included in the catalog of the Warner Archive Collection, which releases classic and cult films from Warner Bros.\\' library on home video.[62] A review in the San Francisco Chronicle called DiCaprio \"his generation\\'s great acting promise\" but criticized the mismatch between Thewlis\\'s \"cultivated\" British accent and DiCaprio\\'s \"Southern California twang\".[63]\\n\\nDiCaprio next starred opposite Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann\\'s Romeo + Juliet (1996), an abridged modernization of William Shakespeare\\'s romantic tragedy, which retained the original Shakespearean dialogue. DiCaprio was initially unsure about another Romeo and Juliet adaptation, but at his father\\'s suggestion, he agreed to examine Luhrmann\\'s work more closely. DiCaprio and Luhrmann then spent a two-week workshop exchanging ideas, which led to the collaboration.[64] Romeo + Juliet established DiCaprio as a leading Hollywood actor; according to film scholar Murray Pomerance, DiCaprio\\'s newfound popularity helped the film become profitable only days after its release.[65][66] Reviewing DiCaprio\\'s early works, David Thomson of The Guardian called DiCaprio \"a revelation\" in What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape, \"very moving\" in This Boy\\'s Life, \"suitably desperate\" in The Basketball Diaries and \"a vital spark\" in Romeo + Juliet.[67] The latter earned DiCaprio a Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival.[68] He then portrayed a young man who has been committed to a mental asylum in Marvin\\'s Room (1996), a family drama about two estranged sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy. He played Hank, the troubled son of Streep\\'s character.[69] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly praised \"the deeply gifted DiCaprio\" for holding his own against veteran actresses Keaton and Streep, describing the three as \"full-bodied and so powerfully affecting that you\\'re carried along on the pleasure of being in the presence of their extraordinary talent\".[70]\\n\\nDiCaprio rejected a role in Boogie Nights (1997) to star opposite Kate Winslet in James Cameron\\'s Titanic as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage.[71] DiCaprio initially had doubts, but was eventually encouraged by Cameron to pursue the part.[72] With a production budget of more than $200\\xa0million,[73][74] the film was the most expensive in history at the time, and was shot at Rosarito, Baja California where a replica of the ship was created.[75] Titanic became the highest-grossing film at the time, eventually earning more than $2.1\\xa0billion in box-office receipts worldwide.[a] The role of Jack Dawson transformed DiCaprio into a superstar, resulting in intense adoration among teenage girls and young women that became known as \"Leo-mania\".[78][79] The film won 11\\xa0Academy Awards—the most wins for any film—including Best Picture, but DiCaprio\\'s failure to gain a nomination led to a protest against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) by more than 200\\xa0fans.[80][81] He was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.[82]\\n\\nDiCaprio stated in 2000: \"I have no connection with me during that whole Titanic phenomenon and what my face became around the world\\xa0[...] I\\'ll never reach that state of popularity again, and I don\\'t expect to\\xa0[...] It\\'s not something I\\'m going to try to achieve either.\"[83] In his 2015 Rolling Stone article, Ebiri called the role DiCaprio\\'s best, writing that he and Winslet \"infuse their earnest back-and-forth with so much genuine emotion that it\\'s hard not to get swept up in their doomed love affair.\"[46] A writer for Vanity Fair in 2008 similarly labeled them \"Hollywood\\'s most iconic screen couple\" since Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.[84] Essaying her first viewing of the film in 2017, Vox contributor Alissa Wilkinson took note of DiCaprio\\'s \"boyish charm\" and found his performance \"natural and unaffected\".[85] The success of Titanic intensified DiCaprio\\'s standing as a teen idol and romantic lead, an image from which he sought to dissociate himself.[79] He reduced his workload \"to learn to hear [his] own voice in choosing the roles\" that he wanted to pursue.[86]\\n\\nDiCaprio had a brief featured role in Woody Allen\\'s 1998 satire of fame, Celebrity. Ebiri labeled DiCaprio \"the best thing in the film\".[46][87] That year, he also took on the dual roles of villainous King Louis XIV and his secret, sympathetic twin brother Philippe in Randall Wallace\\'s The Man in the Iron Mask, with common elements from the 1939 film of the same name and a 1929 film with Douglas Fairbanks.[88] It received mixed to negative reviews,[89] but grossed $180\\xa0million against a budget of $35\\xa0million.[90][91] Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman wrote that DiCaprio did not look old enough to play the part, but praised him as \"a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel\".[92] The Guardian\\'s Alex von Tunzelmann was similarly impressed with the actor\\'s performance but found his talent wasted in the film.[93] DiCaprio won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple for the dual roles in 1999.[94]\\n\\nAlso in 1998, DiCaprio was cast to star in American Psycho (2000) for a reported salary of $20\\xa0million; after disagreements with Oliver Stone on the film\\'s direction, DiCaprio left the project, taking the lead role in The Beach instead.[95] Adapted from Alex Garland\\'s 1996 novel, the film saw him play a backpacking American tourist who ends up in a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand.[96] Budgeted at $50\\xa0million, the film earned almost three times that at the box office,[97] but was negatively reviewed by critics, and earned him a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor.[98][99] Todd McCarthy of Variety thought DiCaprio gave a compelling performance but his character lacked defining qualities.[100] The film received criticism for damaging the filming location in Thailand, after which DiCaprio worked to restore the area.[101]\\n\\nIn the mid-1990s, DiCaprio agreed to be in the mostly improvised black-and-white short film Don\\'s Plum as a favor to aspiring director R. D. Robb.[27] When Robb expanded it to a full-length film, DiCaprio and co-star Tobey Maguire had its release blocked in the US and Canada by court order, arguing they never intended to make a feature film. The film premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival but remains obscure.[102]\\n\\nDiCaprio turned down the role of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002), feeling unprepared to \"take that dive\" at the time.[103] His first film that year was the biopic Catch Me If You Can, based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., who before his 19th birthday committed check fraud to make\\xa0millions in the 1960s.[104] Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot across 147\\xa0different locations in 52\\xa0days, making it \"the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making\" DiCaprio had experienced yet.[105] The film received critical acclaim and grossed $355\\xa0million against a budget of $52\\xa0million, becoming his second highest-grossing release after Titanic.[106][107] Roger Ebert praised his departure from dark and troubled characters,[104] and two Entertainment Weekly critics in 2018 called it DiCaprio\\'s best role, labeling him \"delightfully persuasive, deceptive, flirtatious, and sometimes tragic—and we dare you to find a better role, if you can\".[108] DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film.[109]\\n\\nAlso in 2002, DiCaprio starred in Martin Scorsese\\'s Gangs of New York, a historical drama set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in starring in the film, and thus Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless, production on the film was plagued by overshooting of budgets and producer-director disagreements, resulting in an eight-month shoot. With a budget of $103\\xa0million, the film was the most expensive Scorsese had ever made. DiCaprio was drawn to playing Amsterdam Vallon, the young leader of an Irish-American street gang, as it marked a shift from \"boyish\" roles to a mature leading man.[110] Gangs of New York earned $193\\xa0million worldwide and received positive critical response.[111][112] Anne Thompson of The Observer took note of DiCaprio\\'s \"low-key, sturdy performance\", but felt that co-star Daniel Day-Lewis overshadowed him.[113]\\n\\nIn 2004, DiCaprio founded the production company Appian Way Productions, a namesake of the Italian road.[114] He was interested in finding unique source material and preserving its essence during development, citing previous experiences where the involvement of too many people influenced the final product in a negative way.[115] DiCaprio first executive-produced The Assassination of Richard Nixon, which starred Sean Penn as Samuel Byck,[45] and was screened at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.[116] DiCaprio and Scorsese reunited for a biopic of Howard Hughes, an American film director and aviation pioneer suffering from obsessive–compulsive disorder, in The Aviator (2004), which DiCaprio also co-produced under Appian Way. He initially developed the project with Michael Mann who was eventually replaced by Scorsese.[117][118] The Aviator became a critical and financial success, grossing $213\\xa0million against its budget of $110\\xa0million.[119][120] Simond Braund of Empire thought DiCaprio convincingly played a complex role and highlighted the scenes depicting Hughes\\'s paranoia and obsession.[121] He received his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor — Motion Picture Drama and nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.[122]\\n\\nIn 2006, DiCaprio starred in the crime film The Departed and the political war thriller Blood Diamond. In Scorsese\\'s The Departed, DiCaprio played the role of Billy Costigan, a state trooper working undercover in the Irish Mob in Boston, someone he characterizes as being in a \"constant 24-hour panic attack\". DiCaprio especially liked the experience of working with co-star Jack Nicholson, describing a scene with him as \"one of the most memorable moments\" of his life as an actor.[123] In preparation, he visited Boston to interact with people associated with the Irish Mob and gained 15 pounds (6.8\\xa0kg) of muscle.[124] Critically acclaimed,[125] the film grossed $291\\xa0million against a budget of $90\\xa0million, becoming DiCaprio and Scorsese\\'s highest-grossing collaboration to that point.[126][107] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised DiCaprio\\'s and co-star Matt Damon\\'s performances as \"explosive, emotionally complex\", but felt that Nicholson overshadowed the two.[127] Despite DiCaprio\\'s leading role in The Departed, the film\\'s distributor Warner Bros. Pictures submitted his performance for a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the AMPAS to avoid internal conflict with his part in Blood Diamond.[128] Instead, his co-star Mark Wahlberg was nominated, though DiCaprio earned other accolades for The Departed, including a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor nominations at the Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards.[129]\\n\\nIn Blood Diamond, DiCaprio starred as a diamond smuggler from Rhodesia who is involved in the Sierra Leone Civil War. While filming, he worked with 24\\xa0orphaned children from the SOS Children\\'s Village in Maputo, Mozambique, and said he was touched by his interactions with them.[130] To prepare, he spent six months in Africa, learned about camouflage from people in South African military and interviewed and recorded people in the country to improve his accent.[131] The film received generally favorable reviews,[132] and DiCaprio was noted for his South African accent, which is generally known as difficult to imitate.[133] Claudia Puig of the USA Today approvingly highlighted DiCaprio\\'s transition from a boy to a man on screen,[134] and Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post similarly noted his growth as an actor since The Departed.[135] DiCaprio received nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Blood Diamond.[129]\\n\\nIn 2007, DiCaprio produced the comedy drama Gardener of Eden, which according to The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Frank Scheck \"lack[ed] the necessary dramatic urgency or black humor to connect with audiences\".[136] Later that year, he produced, co-wrote and narrated The 11th Hour, a documentary on the state of the natural environment that won the Earthwatch Environmental Film Award in 2008.[137] DiCaprio\\'s Appian Way produced Planet Green\\'s Greensburg (2008–2010), which ran for three seasons. Set in Greensburg, Kansas, it is about rebuilding the town in a sustainable way after being hit by the 2007 Greensburg tornado.[138] Also in 2008, DiCaprio starred in Body of Lies, a spy film based on the novel of the same name. He played one of three agents battling a terrorist organization in the Middle East.[139] Considering the film to be a throwback to political features of the 1970s like The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975), DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role.[139] The film received mixed reviews from critics,[140] and grossed $118\\xa0million against a budget of $67.5\\xa0million.[141]\\n\\nLater in 2008, DiCaprio collaborated with Kate Winslet for the drama Revolutionary Road, directed by her then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to Titanic, it was Winslet who suggested that they both work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 eponymous novel by Richard Yates. She found that the script, by Justin Haythe, had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster.[142] Playing a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet spent some time together in preparation, and DiCaprio felt claustrophobic on the small set they used.[84][143] He saw his character as \"unheroic\", \"slightly cowardly\" and someone \"willing to be just a product of his environment\".[144] Peter Travers liked DiCaprio\\'s pairing with Winslet and his multi-layered portrayal of an overwhelmed character,[145] and Marshall Sella of GQ called it the \"most mature and memorable performance of his lifetime\".[143] DiCaprio earned his seventh Golden Globes nomination for the film.[146] Revolutionary Road grossed $75.9\\xa0million against its budget of $35\\xa0million.[147] He ended the 2000s by producing director Jaume Collet-Serra\\'s psychological horror thriller film Orphan (2009), starring Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard and Isabelle Fuhrman. Although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success.[148]\\n\\nDiCaprio continued to collaborate with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island, based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. He played Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels, a U.S. Marshal investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island, who comes to question his own sanity. DiCaprio and Scorsese became interested in the project in 2007, and the former co-produced the film under Appian Way with Phoenix Pictures.[149] Because of the film\\'s disturbing scenes, DiCaprio had nightmares of mass murder during production and considered relaxing with his friends a form of therapy.[150] The film was released to mixed reviews;[151] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Scorsese\\'s direction and the acting but criticized its twist ending.[152] Peter Travers called it DiCaprio\\'s \"most haunting and emotionally complex performance yet\", and particularly liked his cave scene with co-star Patricia Clarkson.[153] The film was a commercial success, grossing $294\\xa0million worldwide against a budget of $80\\xa0million.[154]\\n\\nDiCaprio\\'s second role in 2010 was in Christopher Nolan\\'s critically acclaimed ensemble science-fiction film Inception.[155] Inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation,[156] the film features Dom Cobb (DiCaprio), an \"extractor\" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. Cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target\\'s mind.[157] DiCaprio was fascinated with the idea of a \"dream-heist\" and the potential for his character to manipulate his dreamworld and impact his real life.[158] Made on a budget of $160\\xa0million, the film grossed $836\\xa0million worldwide to become DiCaprio\\'s second highest-grossing film.[107][159] To star in this film, DiCaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20\\xa0million fee and opted for a share in first-dollar gross points, which entitled him to a percentage of the cinema ticket sales. The risk proved fruitful, as DiCaprio earned $50\\xa0million from the film, becoming his highest payday yet.[160]\\n\\nDiCaprio starred as J. Edgar Hoover in Clint Eastwood\\'s J. Edgar (2011). A biopic about Hoover, the film focuses on his career as an FBI director, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual.[161] Critics felt that the film lacked coherence overall but commended DiCaprio\\'s performance.[162][163] Roger Ebert praised DiCaprio\\'s ability to bring depth and nuance to the character, suggesting that his performance conveyed aspects of Hoover\\'s personality that were possibly even unknown to the man himself.[164] Also in 2011, he produced Catherine Hardwicke\\'s romantic horror film Red Riding Hood. Though it was named one of the ten worst films of 2011 by Time magazine,[165] it had moderate box-office returns.[166] Also that year, DiCaprio\\'s Appian Way produced George Clooney\\'s political drama The Ides of March, an adaptation of Beau Willimon\\'s 2008 play Farragut North.[167]\\n\\nIn 2012, DiCaprio starred as plantation owner Calvin Candie in Quentin Tarantino\\'s Spaghetti Western, Django Unchained. After reading the script, DiCaprio felt uncomfortable with the extent of racism portrayed in the film, but his co-stars and Tarantino convinced him not to sugarcoat it.[168] While filming, DiCaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming, and Tarantino elected to use the take in the final product.[169] The film received critical acclaim;[170] a writer for Wired magazine commended him for playing a villainous role and found his performance \"blood-chilling\".[171] The film earned DiCaprio a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[172] Django Unchained grossed $425\\xa0million worldwide on a production budget of $100\\xa0million.[173]\\n\\nIn January\\xa02013, DiCaprio said he would take a long break from acting to \"fly around the world doing good for the environment\".[174] That year, he had four releases as an actor and a producer. His first was in the role of millionaire Jay Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann\\'s The Great Gatsby, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald\\'s 1925 novel of the same name, co-starring Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire.[175] The film received mixed reviews from critics, but DiCaprio\\'s performance was praised and earned him the AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.[176][177] Critic Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote that DiCaprio was not only \"tough\\xa0[...] but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. It\\'s a tremendous, hard-won performance.\"[178] Matt Zoller Seitz of Roger Ebert\\'s website described his performance as \"the movie\\'s greatest and simplest special effect\", and \"iconic—maybe his career best\".[179] The film grossed $353\\xa0million worldwide, more than three times its budget.[180] Three films were produced by DiCaprio under Appian Way in 2013—the ensemble crime thriller Runner Runner, which The Guardian\\'s Xan Brooks described as \"a lazy, trashy film that barely goes through the motions\";[181] the commercially failed thriller Out of the Furnace; and the black comedy-drama The Wolf of Wall Street.[182][183]\\n\\nDiCaprio reunited with Scorsese for the fifth time in The Wolf of the Wall Street, a film based on the life of stockbroker Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio), who was arrested in the late\\xa01990s for securities fraud and money laundering.[184][185] DiCaprio wanted to play Belfort ever since he had read his autobiography and won a bidding war with Warner Bros. against Brad Pitt and Paramount Pictures for the rights to Belfort\\'s memoir in 2007.[186][187] He was fond of Belfort\\'s honest and unapologetic portrayal of his actual experiences in the book, and was inspired by the 2008 financial crisis to make the film.[115] The Wolf of Wall Street received positive reviews for Scorsese\\'s and DiCaprio\\'s work together.[188] The Hollywood Reporter\\'s Todd McCarthy lauded DiCaprio for fully realizing his character\\'s potential with a carefree performance.[189] Jonathan Romney of Film Comment wrote that DiCaprio displays a great deal of comedic talent, excelling in \"rubber-limbed slapstick\" humor.[190] The film earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and nominations for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, as well as Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Picture.[191][192]\\n\\nDiCaprio was an executive producer on Virunga, a 2014 British documentary film about four people fighting to protect the world\\'s last mountain gorillas from war and poaching.[193] The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April\\xa02014,[194] and DiCaprio was nominated for the 2015 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special.[195] Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret was another documentary film that year for which he was an executive producer—he took part in the new cut released exclusively on Netflix that September.[196] It explores the impact of animal agriculture on the environment.[197]\\n\\nIn 2015, DiCaprio produced and played fur trapper Hugh Glass in Alejandro G. Iñárritu\\'s survival drama The Revenant. DiCaprio found his role in the film difficult; he had to eat a raw slab of bison\\'s liver and sleep in animal carcasses.[198][199] He also learned to shoot a musket, build a fire, speak two Native American languages (Pawnee and Arikara) and apply ancient healing techniques.[198] Built on a budget of $135\\xa0million, the film earned $533\\xa0million worldwide.[200] The film received positive reviews with particular praise for DiCaprio\\'s acting.[201] Mark Kermode of The Guardian wrote that DiCaprio shone with a performance that prioritizes physicality over speech,[202] and Nick De Semlyen of Empire noted that he uplifted the film.[203] The film earned him numerous awards, including the Academy Award, BAFTA, Critics\\' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG Award for Best Actor.[204][205][206] For the next three years, DiCaprio narrated documentaries and served as a producer for films. In 2016, he was an executive producer for The Ivory Game and Catching the Sun;[183] he also produced, hosted and narrated the documentary Before the Flood about climate change.[207] He produced the crime drama Live by Night (2016), which received unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65\\xa0million production budget.[183][208] His next production ventures were in 2018—the psychological horror Delirium and the commercially failed action–adventure Robin Hood.[209][210]\\n\\nAfter producing and narrating the 2019 global warming documentary Ice on Fire,[211] DiCaprio returned to acting following a four-year break in Quentin Tarantino\\'s comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which traces the relationship between Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), an aging television actor and his stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).[212] To help the film\\'s financing, DiCaprio and Pitt agreed to take a pay cut, and they each received $10\\xa0million.[213] DiCaprio liked working with Pitt, and Tarantino described the pair as the most exciting since Robert Redford and Paul Newman.[214][215] DiCaprio was fascinated with the film\\'s homage to Hollywood and focus on the friendship between his and Pitt\\'s characters. He drew from real-life experience of witnessing the struggles and rejections of his actor friends in the industry.[215] The film premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where critics praised his and Pitt\\'s performances.[216] A writer for Business Insider called it one of the best performances of DiCaprio\\'s career,[217] and Ian Sandwell of Digital Spy particularly liked the duo\\'s chemistry, believing their scenes together to be some of the film\\'s strongest parts.[218] DiCaprio received nominations for an Oscar, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor.[219] The film earned $374\\xa0million against a budget of $90\\xa0million.[220]\\n\\nIn 2020, DiCaprio served as an executive producer for The Right Stuff, a television series adaption of the 1973 namesake book. After being in development at National Geographic, it was released on Disney+.[221] That May, DiCaprio briefly featured in the finale of the miniseries The Last Dance.[222] In 2021, DiCaprio appeared in Adam McKay\\'s satirical comedy Don\\'t Look Up. He spent five months changing the film\\'s script with McKay before agreeing to the part.[223] Starring alongside Jennifer Lawrence as two astronomers attempting to warn humanity about an extinction-level comet, DiCaprio saw this film as an analogy of the world\\'s indifference to the climate crisis. As a frequent supporter of environmentalism, DiCaprio said he has often looked to star in and make films tackling issues related to it, something he found hard due to people\\'s inability to listen. He praised McKay for envisioning a project on how humans would react to a serious issue from a political, social and scientific standpoint.[224] While reviews for the film were mixed, most critics praised DiCaprio\\'s and Lawrence\\'s performances;[225] journalists from Digital Spy and NDTV lauded their pairing.[226][227] DiCaprio earned nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award for the film.[228][229] It broke the record for the most views (152\\xa0million hours) in a single week in Netflix history.[230]\\n\\nDiCaprio next starred in Scorsese\\'s crime drama Killers of the Flower Moon (2023) based on the book of the same name by David Grann,[231] for which he was paid $30 million.[232] Initially signed for the heroic part of FBI agent Thomas Bruce White Sr., DiCaprio insisted on playing the morally complex role of murderer Ernest Burkhart, leading to extensive script rewrites.[233][234] Declaring it the best performance of DiCaprio\\'s career, IndieWire\\'s David Ehrlich wrote that \"his nuanced and uncompromising turn as the cretinous Ernest Burkhart mines new wonders from the actor\\'s long-standing lack of vanity\".[235] He received another Golden Globe nomination for his performance.[236] DiCaprio will next star in Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s upcoming film One Battle After Another, co-starring Sean Penn and Regina Hall.[237]\\n\\nEarly in his career, DiCaprio gained a reputation for his reckless behavior and intense partying with a group of male celebrities dubbed \"the Pussy Posse\" in the 1990s.[42][238] In an infamous article published by New York Magazine in 1998, journalist Nancy Jo Sales criticized the group as men whose pursuit was to \"chase girls, pick fights and not tip the waitress\".[239] During an unknown activity, DiCaprio got himself and friend Justin Herwick almost killed when his parachute failed to open, after which his instructor released an emergency core. In response, DiCaprio said he is fond of doing things that scare him. John McCain, who was a United States Senator for Arizona, called him \"an androgynous wimp\".[238] DiCaprio found people\\'s perception of him exaggerated, adding, \"They want you miserable, just like them. They don\\'t want heroes; what they want is to see you fall.\"[13] Steven Spielberg, who directed him in Catch Me If You Can, defended DiCaprio\\'s reputation as a \"party boy\", believing it is a common behavior for young people and describing him as a family-oriented person during the film\\'s production.[240] Considering DiCaprio to be conscious of his public reputation, The New York Times\\' Caryn James credited him as one of the few actors to use his stardom to further social causes.[55] Carole Cadwalladr of The Guardian said DiCaprio is \"polite, charming, makes jokes, engages eye contact. And manages\\xa0[...] to give almost no hint whatsoever of his actual personality.\"[241]\\n\\nLife can get pretty monotonous. Acting is like living multiple lives. When you make a movie, you go off to different places, live different cultures, investigate somebody else\\'s reality, and you try to manifest that to the best of your ability. It is incredibly eye-opening. That\\'s why I love acting. There\\'s nothing as transformative as what a film, a documentary, can do to get people to care about something else besides their own lives.\\n\\nDiCaprio is regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation.[b] In a 2022 readers\\' poll by Empire, he was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine praised his willingness to \"go to the ends of the earth (often literally) to get under his characters\\' skin\".[246] Colin Covert of The Seattle Times similarly believed DiCaprio \"redefines film stardom\" through his willingness to take on challenging roles that few of his contemporaries are capable of performing.[247]\\n\\nSince his international stardom with Titanic (1997), he has admitted feeling nervous about starring in big-budget studio films because of their hype and marketing campaigns. As an actor, he views film as a \"relevant art form, like a painting or sculpture. A hundred years from now, people will still be watching that movie.\"[3] He often plays roles based on real-life people and stories told in specific periods.[24][248] According to Caryn James, DiCaprio is unafraid of working with established directors on unconventional projects; taking such risks has led him to star in failed films like The Beach (2000),[55] but also his successful collaborations with Martin Scorsese.[249][250] DiCaprio has described his relationship with Scorsese as dreamlike and admires his knowledge of film, crediting the director with having taught him its history and importance.[241] Scorsese has commented on DiCaprio\\'s ability to repeatedly demonstrate emotion on screen.[251] Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club considers the duo\\'s collaborations—which earned them the 2013 National Board of Review (Spotlight Award)[252]—to be career-defining moments for both of them and as vital as Scorsese\\'s acclaimed collaborations with Robert De Niro.[253]\\n\\nAuthor Michael K. Hammond wrote that DiCaprio built his star reputation by demonstrating his acting ability, and praised him for \"revealing a character while concealing the actor\" and \"disappearing into [his] roles\".[254] According to Agnieszka Holland, who directed DiCaprio in Total Eclipse (1995), DiCaprio is \"one of the most mature actors\" she has worked with and is \"courageous\" in his choice of roles.[255] Holland remarked that he does not rely on method acting but rather on a trick that allows him to truly \"become the character\".[255] Meryl Streep, who co-starred with DiCaprio in Marvin\\'s Room, said he possesses the kind of unpredictability that makes his career difficult to classify, his life precarious and his work thrilling.[65] Writing for The Observer, film critic Philip French has asserted that many characters portrayed by DiCaprio are in the process of becoming men. He wrote that DiCaprio\\'s inclination toward films about dysfunctional families and characters seeking father figures may allude to his own troubled childhood.[241] DiCaprio often plays characters who themselves are playing roles, which Caryn James says looks simple on screen but requires sophisticated acting.[55] He tends to play antiheroes and characters who lose their mental stability as the narrative progresses.[256][257] Derek Thompson of The Atlantic argued that DiCaprio gives his best performances when playing \"frauds and cheats and double-crossing liars and mercenaries\".[256]\\n\\nSeveral media publications, such as People,[258] Empire[259] and Harper\\'s Bazaar,[260] have included DiCaprio in their listings of the most attractive actors. In 1998, he sued Playgirl magazine over plans to publish a fully nude picture of him.[261] He has said he does not believe in focusing on appearance—as this is only temporary and can negatively affect one\\'s profession in the industry—and looks for career longevity instead.[262] In 2005, DiCaprio was made a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture for his contributions to the arts.[263] In 2016, he was named one of the 100\\xa0most influential people in the world by Time magazine.[264] He was included on Forbes\\' annual list of the world\\'s highest-paid actors in 2008 and from 2010 to 2016 with respective earnings of $45\\xa0million, $28\\xa0million, $77\\xa0million, $37\\xa0million, $39\\xa0million, $39\\xa0million, $29\\xa0million and $27\\xa0million, topping the list in 2011. The magazine has commended DiCaprio\\'s ability to star in risky, R-rated films that become box office successes.[265] The Hollywood Reporter listed him as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment from 2016 to 2019.[266] A writer for the same magazine credits DiCaprio as the rare actor to have a successful career \"without ever having made a comic book movie, family film or pre-branded franchise. Leo is the franchise.\"[267] Stacey Wilson Hunt, analyzing his career in New York Magazine in 2016, opined DiCaprio, unlike most of his contemporaries, had not starred in a bad film in the previous ten years.[255] Of his success, DiCaprio says, \"My attitude is the same as when I started. I feel very connected to that fifteen-year-old kid who got his first movie.\"[215]\\n\\nDiCaprio has named Robert De Niro and James Dean as two of his favorite and most influential actors, stating \"There were a lot of great actors I really fell in love with, but if I were to pick two, from different generations, it would be De Niro and James Dean\".[212] When asked about a performance that stayed with him the most, DiCaprio responded, \"I remember being incredibly moved by Jimmy Dean, in East of Eden. There was something so raw and powerful about that performance. His vulnerability [...] his confusion about his entire history, his identity, his desperation to be loved. That performance just broke my heart.\"[268]\\n\\nClimate change is real, it is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters, but who speak for all of humanity, for the indigenous people of the world, for the billions and billions of underprivileged people out there who would be most affected by this. For our children\\'s children, and for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed.\\n\\nAn active celebrity in the climate change movement,[270] DiCaprio believes global warming is the world\\'s \"number-one environmental challenge\".[271] Eager to learn about ecology from an early age, he would watch documentaries on rainforest depletion and the loss of species and habitats.[272] In 1998, he established the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness.[273] It supports organizations and campaigns committed to ensuring a viable future for planet Earth, and produced the short web documentaries Water Planet and Global Warning.[274] The foundation has also funded debt-for-nature swaps.[275] By 2018, the foundation had funded more than 200 projects, providing $100 million in support.[276] He has been an active supporter of numerous environmental organizations and sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund and International Fund for Animal Welfare.[274][277]\\n\\nDiCaprio has owned environment-friendly electric-hybrid vehicles.[278] His use of private jets and large yachts have been criticized as hypocritical due to their large carbon footprints.[279][280] DiCaprio chaired the national Earth Day celebration in 2000 where he interviewed Bill Clinton and they discussed plans to deal with global warming and the environment.[281] He presented at the 2007 American leg of Live Earth.[282] DiCaprio donated $1\\xa0million to the Wildlife Conservation Society at Russia\\'s Tiger Summit. DiCaprio\\'s persistence in reaching the event after encountering two plane delays caused then Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to describe him as a \"muzhik\" or \"real man\".[283][284] In 2013, he organized a benefit fine art auction, \"11th\\xa0Hour\", which raised nearly $38.8\\xa0million for his foundation.[285] In September 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon designated DiCaprio as a United Nations Messenger of Peace with a focus on climate change.[286][287] Later that month, he made an opening statement to members of the UN Climate Summit; his speech reached an estimated one billion people worldwide.[288][289] In 2015, he announced his intention to divest from fossil fuels.[290] He again spoke at the UN in April\\xa02016 prior to the signing of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.[291]\\n\\nAt a 2016 meeting with Pope Francis, DiCaprio donated to charity and discussed environmental issues with him. A few days later, possibly influenced by this meeting, the Pope said he would act in a charity film.[c] DiCaprio traveled to Indonesia in early 2016 where he criticized the government\\'s palm oil industry\\'s slash-and-burn forest clearing methods.[293] In July 2016, his foundation donated $15.6\\xa0million to help protect wildlife and the rights of Native Americans, along with mitigating climate change.[294] That October, DiCaprio joined Mark Ruffalo in support of the Standing Rock tribe\\'s opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline.[295]\\n\\nIn April\\xa02017, DiCaprio protested against President Donald Trump\\'s inaction on climate change by attending the People\\'s Climate March.[296] In July, a charity auction and celebrity concert arranged by DiCaprio\\'s foundation had raised over $30\\xa0million in one night.[297] The DiCaprio foundation donated $100\\xa0million in December\\xa02018 to fight climate change.[298] In May\\xa02021, DiCaprio pledged $43\\xa0million to enact conservation operations across the Galápagos Islands.[299]\\n\\nDiCaprio endorsed Hillary Clinton for the 2016\\xa0presidential election.[300] In March 2020, DiCaprio attended a fundraiser for Joe Biden at the home of Paramount Pictures executive Sherry Lansing.[301] Prior to the 2020\\xa0election, DiCaprio narrated a Netflix documentary series about voting rights, stating, \"All of us may have been created equal. But we\\'ll never actually be equal until we all vote. So don\\'t wait.\"[302] On social media, DiCaprio urged voters to make a plan to cast their ballots[303] and to draw attention to voter suppression[304] and restrictive voter ID laws, citing VoteRiders as a source of information and assistance.[305] In 2023, DiCaprio testified during the trial against Prakazrel Michel, who is being accused of participating in a foreign influence campaign that was aimed at the Obama and Trump administrations.[306]\\n\\nIn October 2024, DiCaprio formally endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president, citing her policies on climate change mitigation, while criticizing her Republican opponent Donald Trump.[307]\\n\\nIn 1998, DiCaprio and his mother donated $35,000 for a \"Leonardo DiCaprio Computer Center\" at a library in Los Feliz.[308] In May\\xa02009, DiCaprio joined Kate Winslet, director James Cameron and Canadian singer Celine Dion, in a campaign to raise money to financially support the fees of the nursing home where Millvina Dean, a survivor of the RMS Titanic, was residing. DiCaprio and Winslet donated $20,000 to support Dean.[309] In 2010, he donated $1\\xa0million to relief efforts in Haiti after the earthquake.[310] In 2011, DiCaprio joined the Animal Legal Defense Fund\\'s campaign to release Tony, a tiger that had spent the last decade at a truck stop in Grosse Tête, Louisiana.[311] DiCaprio donated $61,000 to the gay rights group GLAAD in 2013.[312]\\n\\nIn 2016, DiCaprio donated $65,000 to the annual fundraising gala for the Children of Armenia Fund, where he was a special guest of his friend and honorary chair, Tony Shafrazi.[313] Supporting Hurricane Harvey (2017) relief efforts, DiCaprio provided $1\\xa0million through his foundation.[314] In 2020, DiCaprio\\'s foundation donated $3\\xa0million to Australia bushfire relief efforts.[315] Amidst the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the media announced DiCaprio donated $10\\xa0million to support Ukraine,[d][317] although the news agency Associated Press suggested this amount was inaccurate.[316]\\n\\nDiCaprio is agnostic.[318] His personal life is the subject of widespread media attention,[319] though he rarely grants interviews and is reluctant to discuss his private life.[255][320] Since his 40s, DiCaprio has been the focus of various reports detailing his involvement with women aged 25 or younger, and has faced criticism for the age disparity of those relationships.[e][f][327] In 1999, DiCaprio met Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen, whom he dated until 2005.[328] He was romantically involved with Israeli model Bar Refaeli from 2005 to 2011. He later dated German fashion model Toni Garrn from 2013 to 2014 and later in 2017.[329] DiCaprio was briefly romantically linked with Barbadian singer Rihanna, with the pair attending Coachella together in 2016.[330] DiCaprio successfully sued French tabloid Oops\\u200a\\xa0[fr] after it made claims that DiCaprio had gotten Rihanna pregnant.[331] DiCaprio was in a relationship with American model and actress Camila Morrone from 2017 until 2022.[332] He has been dating Italian model Vittoria Ceretti since August 2023.[333]\\n\\nDiCaprio owns houses in Los Angeles and apartments in New York City.[334] In 2009, he bought an island, Blackadore Caye, off mainland Belize—on which he is set to open an environmentally friendly resort[335][336]—and in 2014, he purchased the original Dinah Shore residence designed by architect Donald Wexler in Palm Springs, California.[337]\\n\\nIn 2005, DiCaprio\\'s face was severely injured when model Aretha Wilson hit him over the head with a broken bottle at a Hollywood party. As a result, he required seventeen stitches to his face and neck.[338] Wilson pleaded guilty to the assault and was sentenced in 2010 to two years in prison.[339]\\n\\nDiCaprio has been the subject of several controversies. In 2017, when The Wolf of Wall Street producer Red Granite Pictures was involved in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, DiCaprio turned over the gifts he received from business associates at the production company, including from fugitive businessman Jho Low, to the US government.[340][341] These included a Best Actor Oscar trophy won by Marlon Brando, a $3.2\\xa0million Pablo Picasso painting, and a $9\\xa0million Jean-Michel Basquiat collage.[342] In June\\xa02025, DiCaprio drew criticism by attending the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez. Amazon has faced criticism for its impact on the environment. People questioned DiCaprio\\'s decision, considering his active championing of environmental and humanitarian causes. A photo of DiCaprio at the event showed him hiding his face with his baseball cap.[343] In July\\xa02025, DiCaprio received backlash from activists for co-financing a luxury hotel project near Tel Aviv in Israel despite the ongoing Gaza–Israel conflict, on which he has not commented.[344][345]\\n\\nAccording to the online portal Box Office Mojo and the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, DiCaprio\\'s most critically and commercially successful films include What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Romeo + Juliet (1996), Titanic (1997), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), Blood Diamond (2006), Shutter Island (2010), Inception (2010), Django Unchained (2012), The Great Gatsby (2013), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), The Revenant (2015), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), Don\\'t Look Up (2021), and Killers of the Flower Moon (2023). His films have grossed $7.2\\xa0billion worldwide.[107][346]\\n\\nDiCaprio has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the following:[347][204][219]\\n\\nDiCaprio has won three Golden Globe Awards: Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama for The Aviator and The Revenant and Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for The Wolf of Wall Street,[348] as well as a BAFTA Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor for The Revenant.[349][205]\\n\".'}\n"

      "{'original_prompt': 'You are an helpful agent who will answer the following user question \"What year did the first human land on Mars?\" Use the following retrieved context: \"The idea of sending humans to Mars has been the subject of aerospace engineering and scientific studies since the late 1940s as part of the broader exploration of Mars.[1] Long-term proposals have included sending settlers and terraforming the planet. Currently, only robotic landers, rovers and a helicopter have been on Mars. The farthest humans have been beyond Earth is the Moon, under the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Apollo program which ended in 1972.\\n\\nConceptual proposals for missions that would involve human explorers started in the early 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.[2] The list of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. The plans for these crews have varied—from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation).[citation needed] Some have also considered exploring the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos.[3] By 2020, virtual visits to Mars, using haptic technologies, had also been proposed.[4]\\n\\nMeanwhile, the uncrewed exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades, and was first achieved in 1965 with the Mariner 4 flyby. Human missions to Mars have been part of science fiction since the 1880s, and more broadly, in fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films. The concept of a Martian as something living on Mars is part of the fiction. Proposals for human missions to Mars have come from agencies such as NASA, CNSA, the European Space Agency, Boeing, SpaceX, and space advocacy groups such as the Mars Society and The Planetary Society.\\n\\nThe energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or delta-v, is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earth–Mars trips, the period is every 26 months (2 years, 2 months), so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch periods. Due to the eccentricity of Mars\\'s orbit, the energy needed in the low-energy periods varies on roughly a 15-year cycle[5] with the easiest periods needing only half the energy of the peaks.[6] In the 20th century, a minimum existed in the 1969 and 1971 launch periods and another low in 1986 and 1988, then the cycle repeated.[5] The last low-energy launch period occurred in 2023.[7]\\n\\nSeveral types of mission plans have been proposed, including opposition class and conjunction class,[6] or the Crocco flyby.[8] The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit, a conjunction class mission which would involve a roughly 9-month travel time from Earth to Mars, about 500 days (16\\xa0mo)[citation needed] at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth.[9][10] This would be a 34-month trip.\\n\\n\\nShorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,[11] or under 15 months for an opposition-class expedition, but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days (8.0 months) round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.[12] In 2014, ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.[13]\\nIn the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of Mars and Venus in under a year in space.[14] Some flyby mission architectures can also be extended to include a style of Mars landing with a flyby excursion lander spacecraft.[15] Proposed by R. Titus in 1966, it involved a short-stay lander-ascent vehicle that would separate from a \"parent\" Earth-Mars transfer craft prior to its flyby of Mars. The Ascent-Descent lander would arrive sooner and either go into orbit around Mars or land, and, depending on the design, offer perhaps 10–30 days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle.[15] (See also Mars flyby.)\\n\\nIn the 1980s, it was suggested that aerobraking at Mars could reduce the mass required for a human Mars mission lifting off from Earth by as much as half.[16] As a result, Mars missions have designed interplanetary spacecraft and landers capable of aerobraking.[16]\\n\\nA number of uncrewed spacecraft have landed on the surface of Mars, while some, such as Beagle2 (2003) and the Schiaparelli EDM (2016), have failed what is considered a difficult landing. Among the successes:\\n\\nWhen an expedition reaches Mars, braking is required to enter orbit. Two options are available: rockets or aerocapture. Aerocapture at Mars for human missions was studied in the 20th century.[17] In a review of 93 Mars studies, 24 used aerocapture for Mars or Earth return.[17] One of the considerations for using aerocapture on crewed missions is a limit on the maximum force experienced by the astronauts. The current scientific consensus is that 5 g, or five times Earth\\'s gravity, is the maximum allowable deceleration.[17]\\n\\nConducting a safe landing requires knowledge of the properties of the atmosphere, first observed by Mariner 4, and a survey of the planet to identify suitable landing sites. Major global surveys were conducted by Mariner 9, Viking 1, and two orbiters, which supported the Viking landers. Later orbiters, such as Mars Global Surveyor, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later surveys have identified the probable locations of water, a critical resource.[18]\\n\\nSending humans to Mars will be expensive.  In 2010, one estimate was roughly US$500 billion, but the actual costs will likely be more.[19]  Starting in the late 1950s, the early phase of space exploration was conducted as a space race by lone nations, as much to make a political statement as to study the Solar System.  This proved to be unsustainable, and the current climate is one of international cooperation, with large projects such as the International Space Station and the proposed Lunar Gateway being built and launched by multiple countries.[citation needed]\\n\\nCritics argue that the immense cost outweighs the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars and that funds could be better redirected toward other programs, such as robotic exploration.  Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation.  There are also claims that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity\\'s survival.[19]\\n\\nOne factor to reduce the cost of sending human to Mars may be space tourism.  Growth in that business and technological developments would bring economies of scale and thus a lower cost of human spaceflight.  A similar concept can be examined in the history of personal computers: when computers were used only for scientific research, with minor use in big industry, they were big, rare, heavy, and costly. When the potential market increased, and they started to become common in businesses and later in homes (in Western and developed countries), the computing power of home devices skyrocketed, and prices plummeted.[20]\\n\\nSeveral key physical challenges exist for human missions to Mars:[24]\\n\\nSome of these issues were estimated statistically in the HUMEX study.[41] Ehlmann and others have reviewed political and economic concerns, as well as technological and biological feasibility aspects.[42] While fuel for roundtrip travel could be a challenge, methane and oxygen can be produced using Martian H2O (preferably as water ice instead of liquid water) and atmospheric CO2 with sufficiently mature technology.[43]\\n\\nRobotic spacecraft that travel to Mars require sterilization. The allowable limit is 300,000 spores on the exterior of general craft, with stricter requirements for spacecraft bound for \"special regions\" containing water.[44][45] Otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.[46]\\n\\nSterilizing human missions to this level is impossible, as humans are typically host to a hundred trillion (1014) microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiota, and these cannot be removed. Containment seems the only option, but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing (i.e., a crash).[47] There have been several planetary workshops on this issue, yet there are no final guidelines for a way forward.[48] Human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to Earth if they become carriers of microorganisms.[49]\\n\\n\\nOver the past seven decades, a wide variety of mission architectures have been proposed or studied for human spaceflights to Mars. These have included chemical, nuclear, and electric propulsion, as well as a wide variety of landing, living, and return methodologies.\\nA number of nations and organizations have long-term intentions to send humans to Mars.\\n\\nSignificant technological hurdles need to be overcome for human spaceflight to Mars.\\n\\nEntry into the thin and shallow Martian atmosphere will pose significant difficulties with re-entry; compared to Earth\\'s much denser atmosphere, any spacecraft will descend very rapidly to the surface and must be slowed.[58] A heat shield has to be used.[59] NASA is carrying out research on retropropulsive deceleration technologies to develop new approaches to Mars atmospheric entry. A key problem with propulsive techniques is handling the fluid flow problems and attitude control of the descent vehicle during the supersonic retropropulsion phase of the entry and deceleration.[60]\\n\\nA return mission from Mars will need to land a rocket to carry crew off the surface. Launch requirements mean that this rocket could be significantly smaller than an Earth-to-orbit rocket. Mars-to-orbit launch can also be achieved in single stage. Despite this, landing an ascent rocket back on Mars will be difficult.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn 2014, NASA proposed the Mars Ecopoiesis Test Bed.[61]\\n\\nOne of the medical supplies that might be needed is a considerable mass of intravenous fluid, which is mainly water, but contains other substances so it can be added directly to the human blood stream. If it could be created on the spot from existing water, this would reduce mass requirements. A prototype for this capability was tested on the International Space Station in 2010.[62]\\n\\nA person who is inactive for an extended period of time loses strength, muscle and bone mass. Spaceflight conditions are known to cause loss of bone mineral density in astronauts, increasing bone fracture risk. The most recent mathematical models predict 33% of astronauts will be at risk for osteoporosis during a human mission to Mars.[35] A resistive exercise device similar to an Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) would be needed in the spaceship but would not fully counteract the loss of bone mineral density.\\n\\nWhile humans can breathe pure oxygen, usually additional gases such as nitrogen are included in the breathing mix. One possibility is to use in situ nitrogen and argon from the atmosphere of Mars, but they are hard to separate from each other.[63] As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.[63]\\n\\nAn idea for keeping carbon dioxide out of the breathing air is to use reusable amine-bead carbon dioxide scrubbers.[64] While one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the astronaut\\'s air, the other is vented to the Mars atmosphere.[64]\\n\\nIf humans are to live on Mars, growing food on Mars may be necessary – with numerous related challenges.[66] Making soil useful for growing plants using existing Mars regolith is made more difficult by the lack of any organic material in the regolith and by the existence of about 0.5% perchlorates, a toxic salt that would damage the thyroid, kidneys and human cells in general.[67] The environment is also too cold and lacks water except possibly at the poles.[67]\\n\\nIn 2022, NASA co-funded a multi-year grant of US$1.9 million awarded to Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, and the Florida Institute of Technology to explore the idea of using Dehalococcoides mccartyi bacteria, among other microbes, to reduce the perchlorate content and add organic material to simulated Mars regolith.[68] D. mccartyi also break down the perchlorates into harmless chloride and useful oxygen along with leaving organics in the soil as excretions and when they die,[68] thus potentially solving several problems at one time.\\n\\nSome missions may be considered a \"Mission to Mars\" in their own right, or they may only be one step in a more in-depth program. Examples include planetary flyby missions, missions to Mars\\'s moons, and study of the effects of the Martian environment on spacesuit materials by the Perseverance rover.[69]\\n\\nMany Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos[70] – not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission. Lockheed Martin, as part of their \"Stepping stones to Mars\" project, called the \"Red Rocks Project\", proposed to explore Mars robotically from Deimos.[71][72][73]\\n\\nUse of fuel produced from water resources on Phobos or Deimos has also been proposed.\\n\\nAn uncrewed Mars sample return mission (MSR) has sometimes been considered as a precursor to crewed missions to the Mars surface.[74] In 2008, the ESA called a sample return \"essential\" and said it could bridge the gap between robotic and human missions to Mars.[74] An example of a Mars sample return mission is Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars.[75] Mars sample return was the highest priority Flagship Mission proposed for NASA by the Planetary Decadal Survey 2013–2022: The Future of Planetary Science.[76] However, such missions have been hampered by complexity and expense, with one ESA proposal involving no fewer than five different uncrewed spacecraft.[77]\\n\\nSample return plans raise the concern, however remote, that an infectious agent could be brought to Earth.[77] Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return has been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)[78]\\n\\nAt the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions,[79] of which three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing.[79]\\n\\nThe rover Perseverance, which landed on Mars in 2021, is equipped with a device that allows it to collect rock samples to be returned at a later date by another mission.[80] Perseverance, as part of the Mars 2020 mission, was launched on an Atlas V rocket on 30 July 2020.[81]\\n\\nStarting in 2004, NASA scientists have proposed to explore Mars via telepresence from human astronauts in orbit.[82][83]\\n\\nA similar idea was the proposed \"Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic Operations\" mission.[84][85]\\n\\nIn order to reduce communications latency, which ranges from 4 to 24 minutes,[86] a crewed Mars orbital station has been proposed to control robots and Mars aircraft without long latency.[87]\\n\".'}\n"

      "{'original_prompt': 'You are an helpful agent who will answer the following user question \"What was the name of the Zodiac killer?\" Use the following retrieved context: \"The Zodiac Killer is the pseudonym of an unidentified serial killer who murdered five known victims in the San Francisco Bay Area between December 1968 and October 1969. The case has been described as \"arguably the most famous unsolved murder case in American history,\" and has become both a fixture of popular culture and a focus for efforts by amateur detectives.\\n\\nThe Zodiac\\'s known attacks took place in Benicia, Vallejo, unincorporated Napa County, and the City and County of San Francisco proper. He attacked three young couples and a lone male cab driver. Two of these victims survived. The Zodiac coined his name in a series of taunting messages that he mailed to regional newspapers, in which he threatened killing sprees and bombings if they were not printed. He also said that he was collecting his victims as slaves for the afterlife. He included four cryptograms or ciphers in his correspondence; two were decrypted in 1969 and 2020, and two are generally considered to be unsolved.[1]\\n\\nIn 1974, the Zodiac claimed 37 victims in his last confirmed letter. This tally included victims in Southern California such as Cheri Jo Bates, who was murdered in Riverside in 1966. Despite many theories about the Zodiac\\'s identity, the only suspect authorities ever named was Arthur Leigh Allen, a former elementary school teacher and convicted sex offender who died in 1992.\\n\\nThe unusual nature of the case led to international interest that has been sustained throughout the years. The San Francisco Police Department marked the case \"inactive\" in 2004 but re-opened it prior to 2007. The case also remains open in the California Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, the city of Vallejo, as well as in Napa and Solano counties.\\n\\nInvestigators agree on four confirmed attacks by the Zodiac Killer in California. Five victims were killed during these attacks, and two survived:[2]\\n\\nFrom 1969 to 1974, the Zodiac mailed heavily misspelled letters and ciphers to law enforcement and media outlets. Some letters began, \"This is the Zodiac speaking\" and were signed with a symbol resembling the crosshairs of a gunsight: .[3] Four of the mailings had a cryptogram enclosed. Two have been solved, in 1969 and 2020.[4] The letters were postmarked in San Francisco and Pleasanton.[5]\\n\\nThe Zodiac\\'s confirmed correspondence with date, recipient, and incipit:\\n\\nThe first murders retroactively attributed to the Zodiac were the shootings of high school students Betty Lou Jensen (16) and David Arthur Faraday (17) on December 20, 1968. Faraday was a student at Vallejo High School, while Jensen was a student at Hogan High School. At 8:30\\xa0p.m. Faraday picked up Jensen, and the couple visited one of Jensen\\'s friends. Sometime after 9 p.m., they drove to the outskirts of Vallejo and parked at a lover\\'s lane on Lake Herman Road, just inside Benicia city limits. Between 10:15 and 10:30 p.m., a passing motorist noticed the couple parked on a gravel runoff near the gate to a water pumping station. They were spotted again at 11 p.m.[6][7]:\\u200a30–1\\u200a\\n\\nBetween 11:05 and 11:10 p.m., Faraday and Jensen were attacked. Police determined that their assailant parked his vehicle about ten feet alongside the passenger side of Faraday\\'s car. He fired several shots at Faraday\\'s car as he walked around to the driver\\'s side. None of the shots hit Faraday and Jensen. The couple scrambled to get out through the passenger door. Jensen succeeded. As Faraday was exiting, the killer shot him in the head with a .22-caliber pistol. The assailant chased Jensen as she fled, firing six shots at her back. Only one missed. Police theorized the whole attack took two to three minutes.[7]:\\u200a30–1\\u200a[8]\\n\\nAt 11:10\\xa0p.m., a motorist spotted the couple\\'s bodies and alerted police. Jensen was dead. Faraday was still breathing. He died at the hospital. There were no witnesses and no usable tire or foot prints. The only motive the police could deduce was a \"madman\" wanting to kill. Despite an intense investigation in the following months, no viable suspects emerged.[7]:\\u200a30–2\\u200a The murders were extensively covered by the media.[7]:\\u200a37–8\\u200a\\n\\nDarlene Ferrin (22) and Michael Mageau (19) were shot shortly after midnight on July 4, 1969. Ferrin was popular in Vallejo due to her job at a local restaurant, where she met Mageau. On July 4, they went on a date despite the fact that Ferrin was married. After 11:30\\xa0p.m., Ferrin received a phone call at her house. She arrived at Mageau\\'s house around 11:50\\xa0p.m.[7]:\\u200a32–5\\u200a\\n\\nImmediately after leaving Mageau\\'s house, the couple noticed they were being followed by a man in a light-colored car. Ferrin drove out of Vallejo in the direction of Lake Herman Road. Shortly before midnight, she turned her car into an empty parking lot at Blue Rock Springs Park.[9][10] This was another lover\\'s lane, located just two miles from Lake Herman Road. Ferrin either parked or stalled 70 feet from the lot entrance.[11]:\\u200a26\\u200a Another vehicle parked about 80 feet to their left. The driver turned his headlights off and sat motionless. Mageau asked who the driver was. Ferrin told him not to worry. The stranger abruptly tore away from the parked couple.[7]:\\u200a34\\u200a\\n\\nFive minutes later, the stranger returned, parked a few feet next to Mageau\\'s side of the car and got out. He shone a flashlight into Ferrin\\'s car as he approached. Assuming he was a police officer, the couple rolled down Mageau\\'s window. Without speaking, the stranger fired a 9mm pistol into the car.[12] One bullet hit Mageau in the right arm, and the other hit Ferrin in the neck. Mageau tried to leave the car, but his door handle was missing or removed. The assailant returned to his car, opened the door, and did something Mageau could not see. As Mageau struggled to exit the vehicle, the stranger shot him and Ferrin two more times each. The killer hurried into his car and drove off. A golf course caretaker heard the shots around 12:10\\xa0a.m.[7]:\\u200a34–5\\u200a The perpetrator left no clues that could be traced back to him.[7]:\\u200a38\\u200a\\n\\n\\nThree teenagers drove into the parking lot, saw the wounded couple, and got help. Police arrived at 12:20\\xa0a.m. Twenty minutes later, Ferrin was pronounced dead at the hospital. Mageau survived and described the attacker as a heavyset white man, around 5\\'8\" tall. He estimated the assailant\\'s weight as 195–200 pounds, with a large face and curly light brown hair. The killer wore dark clothes and no glasses. These details were not enough to develop a suspect.[7]:\\u200a35,\\u200a41\\u200a Moments after 12:40\\xa0a.m., the Vallejo Police Department (VPD) received a phone call from a payphone two blocks from headquarters. The man on the other end of the line said:\\n\"I want to report a double murder. If you go one mile east on Columbus Parkway to the public park you will find kids in a brown car. They were shot with a 9-millimeter Luger. I also killed those kids last year. Goodbye.\"[7]:\\u200a35,\\u200a39\\u200a\\nSerial killers will commonly pause to reflect on their actions. Authors Michael Kelleher and David Van Nuys speculated that the seven months between the attacks on Lake Herman Road and at Blue Rock Springs was a \"cooling off period\" for the Zodiac.[7]:\\u200a37–8\\u200a\\n\\nMany have speculated that Darlene Ferrin knew her killer. Kelleher and Nuys credit the origin of the theory to Robert Graysmith\\'s 1986 book Zodiac. He argued extensively for a connection based on interviews with Ferrin\\'s friends.[11]:\\u200a39ff\\u200a A definitive connection has not been proven.\\n\\nMageau gave conflicting accounts on whether Ferrin knew her killer. At the hospital, he stated he did not know the murderer. At another point, he said the assailant\\'s name was \"Richard\". Ferrin\\'s sister claimed one of Darlene\\'s boyfriends was named Richard.[13] In the Zodiac\\'s later correspondence, he only ever refers to Ferrin as \"girl\".[7]:\\u200a32,\\u200a35–6\\u200a\\n\\nIn Graysmith\\'s telling, Ferrin and Mageau were chased. They only stopped when their car hit a log and stalled. The detective on the scene noticed that the car was still on and in low gear.[11]:\\u200a31\\u200a Kelleher and Nuys suggest that Ferrin would not tell Mageau to ignore the mystery driver, nor would they assume he was a police officer, if they had not stopped at the spot by choice.[7]:\\u200a36–7\\u200a\\n\\nFerrin did know Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday. She lived less than two blocks from Jensen and attended Hogan High School. She was also familiar with Lake Herman Road\\'s status as a lover\\'s lane.[7]:\\u200a32–3\\u200a There is a picture of Ferrin and an unknown man who closely resembles a composite sketch of the Zodiac. In a 2011 episode of America\\'s Most Wanted, police stated they believe the photo was taken in San Francisco in either 1966 or 1967.[14]\\n\\nOn August 1, 1969, the Vallejo Times, San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner all received letters written by someone taking credit for the attacks in Vallejo. The three letters were nearly identical and began, \"I am the killer of the 2 teenagers last Christmass at Lake Herman & the girl last 4th of July.\" The three letters were rife with misspellings and presented the first definitive link between the two separate attacks in Vallejo.[15][16]\\n\\nEnclosed in all three letters was a different cryptogram. They combined to form a 408-symbol cipher (Z408). The writer claimed, \"In this cipher is my idenity [sic].\" He demanded the codes be printed on each newspaper\\'s front page. If they were not, he threatened to \"cruise around all weekend killing lone people in the night then move on to kill again, until I end up with a dozen people over the weekend.\"[11]:\\u200a49\\u200a The Chronicle published its third of the cryptogram inside the August 2 edition. In the accompanying article, Vallejo Police Chief Jack E. Stiltz said, \"We\\'re not satisfied that the letter was written by the murderer\". He requested the killer send more facts to prove his identity.[17]\\n\\nOn August 4, the Examiner received a letter with the salutation, \"Dear Editor This is the Zodiac speaking.\" This letter marked the debut of the Zodiac persona.[18]:\\u200a161\\u200a It was the first time the killer called himself by this nickname.[19]\\n\\nIn this second letter to the media, the killer wrote at much greater length. He happily obliged Chief Stiltz\\'s request for more information about both murders. He provided minute details about how he shot Michael Mageau. He described the golf course caretaker. Regarding the Lake Herman Road attack, he revealed that he had taped a flashlight to his gun in order to aim easily in the dark. The August 4 letter also referred investigators back to the Z408 cipher. The killer wrote, \"when they do crack it they will have me\".[11]:\\u200a55–57\\u200a\\n\\nThe decoded message did not reveal the Zodiac\\'s identity. Both the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) attempted to decrypt the Z408 cipher. On August 5, it was cracked by Donald and Bettye Harden, a couple in Salinas. Neither was a cryptologist. Bettye deployed a crib by correctly guessing the word \"kill\" would appear in the message.[18]:\\u200a162ff\\u200a\\n\\nThe message was rife with misspellings and referred to Richard Connell\\'s 1924 short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\". The Zodiac explained killing was a way of collecting slaves for his afterlife. The full text of the decoded Z408 cipher reads:\\n\\n\"I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forrest because man is the most dangeroue anamal of all to kill something gives me the most thrilling experence it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl the best part of it is thae when I die I will be reborn in paradice and all the I have killed will become my slaves I will not give you my name because you will try to sloi down or atop my collectiog of slaves for my afterlife ebeorietemethhpiti\"[11]:\\u200a54–5\\u200a\\nVPD asked a psychiatrist at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville to analyze the Zodiac\\'s message. The doctor concluded the writer felt omnipotent based on his fantasy about collecting spiritual slaves. The analysis described the Zodiac as \"someone you would expect to be brooding and isolated\". The psychiatrist speculated the killer\\'s praise of murder over sex could be \"an expression of inadequacy\".[20]\\n\\nAt 4:00\\xa0p.m. on September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College students Bryan Hartnell (20) and Cecelia Shepard (22) were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a small island connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. Sometime later, Shepard noticed a man watching them. When he emerged from behind a tree, he put on a black executioner\\'s hood with clip-on sunglasses.[21] He wore a bib with a white 3x3\"  symbol on it. He brandished a gun, which Hartnell believed was a .45. The Zodiac said he escaped from jail after killing a guard and needed their car and money to travel to Mexico.[22][23]:\\u200a20\\u200a\\n\\nBefore tying up Shepard, the Zodiac made Shepard bind Hartnell with precut lengths of plastic clothesline. He tightened Hartnell\\'s bonds because Shepard\\'s knots were too loose. Hartnell still believed they were being robbed when the Zodiac drew a knife and stabbed them. Hartnell suffered six wounds and Shepard ten.[20][24]\\n\\n\\nThe Zodiac hiked 500 yards to Knoxville Road, leaving several footprints for investigators to study. The killer drew the  symbol on Hartnell\\'s car door with a black felt-tip pen and wrote beneath it:\\nVallejo\\n12-20-68\\n7-4-69\\nSept 27–69–6:30\\nby knife[25]\\n\\nAfter hearing the victims\\' screams, a fisherman and his son sought help. Hartnell untied Shepard\\'s ropes with his teeth, and she freed him.[11]:\\u200a73\\u200a Two park rangers arrived and tended to the stricken couple until the ambulance arrived. Napa County deputies Dave Collins and Ray Land responded to the report of the attack.[21] Shepard was conscious and gave a detailed description of their attacker. She and Hartnell were taken to a hospital in Napa. Shepard lapsed into a coma during transport; she never regained consciousness and died two days later. Hartnell survived to recount his tale to the press.[26][27]\\n\\nEarlier that day, a suspicious man had been seen around Lake Berryessa by several people. A dentist and his son saw a heavyset man looking at them from a distance before he hurried off. Around 2:50\\xa0p.m., three women noticed a strange man as they stopped on their way to Lake Berryessa. After they had arrived to sunbathe, they noticed the man again.[11]:\\u200a63f\\u200a Since they had potentially seen the Zodiac without his hood, the women worked with Napa Valley Register photographer Robert McKenzie to create a composite sketch using an Identi-Kit facial compositing device. Police showed the image to other potential witnesses.\\n\\nThe suspect was described as being roughly 6\\' tall and weighing 200 pounds, which matched the descriptions by Shepard and Hartnell.[25][11]:\\u200a78\\u200a Graysmith also drew a sketch of the Zodiac\\'s costume after Hartnell described it to him.[28] Napa County detective Ken Narlow was assigned to the case from the outset and worked on solving the crime until his retirement in 1987.[29]\\n\\nThe Zodiac drove 27 miles from the crime scene to a car wash in downtown Napa. He used a payphone to call the Napa County Sheriff\\'s Department at 7:40\\xa0p.m. He told the dispatcher he wished to \"report a murder – no, a double murder\" and confessed to the crime.[25] He did not hang up the phone.[23]:\\u200a21\\u200a KVON radio reporter Pat Stanley found the phone off the hook a few minutes later. The payphone was located a few blocks from the sheriff\\'s office. Detectives lifted a wet palm print from the phone but were never able to match it to any suspect.[30]\\n\\nThe last confirmed Zodiac murder took place two weeks after the Lake Berryessa attacks. Around 9:40\\xa0p.m. on October 11 in downtown San Francisco, the Zodiac hailed a cab which was driven by a doctoral student named Paul Stine. The killer gave a destination in Presidio Heights. When the taxi arrived at Washington and Maple streets, the killer asked to be driven another block. At Washington and Cherry around 9:55\\xa0p.m., the Zodiac shot Stine in the head with a handgun and took his wallet and car keys.[16]\\n\\nThree teenagers witnessed the crime from a house directly across the street from Stine\\'s cab. The Zodiac\\'s face was clearly visible by streetlight.[31] The teenagers watched as the Zodiac wiped down the vehicle and rifled through Stine\\'s clothes. He left behind two partial fingerprints from his right hand. While the Zodiac was tending to the cab, the kids called the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). They described the criminal as a \"husky\" white man in a \"dark or black jacket\". The dispatcher mistakenly alerted SFPD that the suspect was Black.[7]:\\u200a76–7\\u200a\\n\\nJust two minutes after the call to SFPD, two nearby patrol officers responded to the radio dispatch. They encountered a white man in dark clothes walking north towards the Presidio army base. They pulled alongside the man and asked if he had seen anything suspicious. The man confirmed he had seen someone waving a gun and heading east. The officers hurried away. The Zodiac later claimed he was the witness that spoke to the two officers. When police arrived at the scene, Stine was declared dead. SFPD canvassed the area, including the Presidio. The Zodiac had probably fled the area in a car by then.[7]:\\u200a77–8\\u200a\\n\\nPolice assumed the murder was a result of the robbery. However, the Zodiac mailed a bloody piece of Paul Stine\\'s shirt to the San Francisco Chronicle on October 13.[23]:\\u200a27\\u200a He enclosed it in a letter where he boasted about the murder and claimed to have clandestinely watched SFPD search for him. The Zodiac also threatened to shoot a tire on a school bus and kill children as they exited.[16]\\n\\nThe teenage witnesses helped a police artist make a composite sketch of the man they saw at Stine\\'s cab. The two patrol officers who questioned the witness near the scene realized it may have been the Zodiac. They also helped develop a sketch of the suspect.[31][7]:\\u200a78\\u200a\\n\\nSFPD detectives Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi were assigned to the case.[7]:\\u200a78\\u200a Toschi ended up working on the case by himself and filled eight filing cabinets with potential suspects.[32] In 1976 he told the Associated Press that Zodiac\\'s letters were an \"ego game\". He believed the killer lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, \"He\\'s a weekend killer. Why can\\'t he get away Monday through Thursday? Does his job keep him close to home? I would speculate he maybe has a menial job, is well thought of and blends into the crowd...I think he\\'s quite intelligent and better educated than someone who misspells words as frequently as he does in his letters.\"[33]\\n\\nAfter working on the Zodiac case for seven years, Toschi started writing anonymous letters praising his own investigative work to Chronicle columnist Armistead Maupin. Two years later in 1978, Toschi was removed from the case and demoted to pawn shop detail. He expressed regret for the hoax. That same year, Maupin also received a purported Zodiac letter. SFPD investigated whether Toschi wrote it as well and concluded he did not.[34][35]\\n\\nOn October 22, 1969, mental patient Eric Weill duped attorney Melvin Belli into a conversation on KGO-TV\\'s A.M. San Francisco. Investigators concluded Weill was not the Zodiac. He called the Oakland Police Department and demanded to speak to Belli or F. Lee Bailey on television. During the show, Weill told Belli he would not reveal his identity for fear of being executed. He arranged a rendezvous with Belli on Mission Street in Daly City and did not show.[36][23]:\\u200a32\\u200a\\n\\nOn November 8, the Zodiac mailed a card with a 340-character cryptogram (Z340) to the Chronicle. He asked for his code to be printed on the front page. It remained unsolved for 51 years. One cryptologist ranked Zodiac\\'s unsolved ciphers second only to the Voynich manuscript.[37] Zodiac ciphers were crowdsourced through a variety of websites, which led to gradual breakthroughs.[38][39]\\n\\nZ340 was deciphered by an international team of private citizens on December 5, 2020. The cryptology group included American software engineer David Oranchak, Australian mathematician Sam Blake and Belgian programmer Jarl Van Eycke.[40][41] Using a program made by Van Eycke called AZdecrypt, the team ran 650,000 possible solutions for the cipher until the program came up with the best possible encryption key.[42][43]\\n\\nIn the decrypted message, the Zodiac denied being the \"Sam\" who spoke on A.M. San Francisco and explained he was not afraid of the gas chamber \"because it will send me to paradice all the sooner.\" The team submitted their findings to the FBI\\'s Cryptographic and Racketeering Records Unit, which verified the decryption and concluded the decoded message gave no further clues to the Zodiac\\'s identity.[40][41][44] Subsequent analysis confirmed the Z340 decryption using unicity distance as a measure.[38]\\n\\n\\nThe decoded Z340 cipher included the usual Zodiac respellings:\\n\"I hope you are having lots of fan in trying to catch me that wasn\\'t me on the TV show which bringo up a point about me I am not afraid of the gas chamber becaase it will send me to paradlce all the sooher because e now have enough slaves to worv for me where every one else has nothing when they reach paradice so they are afraid of death I am not afraid because i vnow that my new life is life will be an easy one in paradice death\"[44][45]\\nOn November 9, the Zodiac mailed a seven-page letter to the Chronicle. In his postscript, he claimed he was stopped and questioned by two policemen three minutes after he shot Stine. He threatened to blow up a school bus and included a diagram of the bomb. The Zodiac boasted police would never catch him because \"I have been to clever for them\".[16] The Chronicle excerpted the letter on November 12.[46]\\n\\nOne year after the Lake Herman Road murders on December 20, the Zodiac mailed a letter to Melvin Belli. He enclosed another swatch of Paul Stine\\'s shirt. He pleaded, \"Please help me I am drownding...I can not remain in control for much longer.\"[23]:\\u200a35\\u200a\\n\\nFor the remainder of 1970, the Zodiac continued to communicate with authorities and the press by mail. In a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle postmarked April 20, he wrote, \"My name is—\". It was followed by a 13-character cipher (Z13) which has not been definitively solved.[47]\\n\\nThe Z13 cipher:\\n\\n\\nThe cryptologist Craig P. Bauer proposed the solution \"Alfred E. Neuman\", the mascot of humor magazine Mad.[18] Ryan Garlick, a University of North Texas computer science and engineering professor, used the key to the Z340 to get the solution \"Dr. Eat a Torpedo\". Garlick believes that this is an insult directed at D. C. B. Marsh, then president of the American Cryptogram Association, who had publicly challenged Zodiac to reveal his full name in a cipher.[48]\\nIn the same letter, the Zodiac denied responsibility for the fatal bombing of an SFPD police station in Golden Gate Park. He added, \"there is more glory to killing a cop than a cid because a cop can shoot back.\"[49] He also included a diagram of another school bus bomb. At the bottom of the diagram, he wrote: \" = 10, SFPD = 0.\"\\n\\nOn April 28, 1970, the Zodiac mailed a greeting card to the Chronicle. He wrote, \"I hope you enjoy yourselves when I have my BLAST.\" On the back of the card, the Zodiac threatened to use his bus bomb unless two things happened: the Chronicle should write about his bomb, and people should wear \"some nice Zodiac butons\".[50]\\n\\nIn a letter to the Chronicle postmarked June 26, 1970, the killer was upset no one was wearing Zodiac buttons. He claimed, \"...I punished them in another way. I shot a man sitting in a parked car with a .38.\" This may have been a reference to the murder of SFPD Sergeant Richard Radetich. He was shot through the window of his squad car by an unidentified gunman during a routine traffic stop.[51] Radetich\\'s murder is unsolved, but the SFPD denies that Zodiac is a suspect in the case.[49]\\n\\nA Phillips 66 roadmap of the San Francisco Bay Area was enclosed with the letter. At Mount Diablo, the Zodiac drew a modified  symbol as a compass rose. The cardinal points were labeled 0, 3, 6, 9 clockwise from the top. The Zodiac confirmed that 0 \"to be set to Mag. N.\"\\n\\nThe letter concluded with a 32-character cipher (Z32):\\n\\nThe Zodiac claimed that the map and the cipher would reveal where he had buried his bomb. Z32 has never been definitively decoded and no bomb was ever located.[42][47] In another letter, the Zodiac explained, \"The Mt. Diablo code concerns Radians + # inches along the radians.\"[52] In 1981, Gareth Penn deduced that when the map was divided as per the Zodiac\\'s hint, three of his attacks aligned along one radian.[53]:\\u200a3–4\\u200a On one arm of the radian lay the Blue Rock Springs and Lake Herman Road murders. The other arm of the radian centered on Mount Diablo extended to the site of Paul Stine\\'s murder.[18]:\\u200a190\\u200a\\n\\nHundreds of solutions to the Z13 and Z32 have been proposed and, according to Oranchak, “it is practically impossible to determine if any of them are correct” due to how short the ciphers are.[54]\\n\\nIn a letter postmarked July 24, 1970 to the Chronicle, the Zodiac again complained about no one wearing Zodiac-themed buttons. He claimed to have \"a little list\" of victims which included the woman and her baby he drove around for several hours. The details match Kathleen Johns\\' description of her abduction on March 22, four months earlier.\\n\\nTwo days later on July 26, the Zodiac mailed another letter to the Chronicle. He again parodied \"As Some Day It May Happen (I Have a Little List)\" from The Mikado, adding his own lyrics about his potential victims. The letter was signed with a large Zodiac symbol and a new score: \" = 13, SFPD = 0\". The letter\\'s postscript explained the Mount Diablo code from his previous letter.\\n\\nOn October 7, 1970, the Chronicle received a three-by-five-inch card (nicknamed the \"13 Hole Punch Card\") signed by Zodiac with the  symbol and a small cross reportedly drawn in blood.[55] Thirteen holes were punched across the card, and its message was formed by pasting type from the Chronicle. Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi agreed it was \"highly probable\" that Zodiac sent the card.[56]\\n\\nOn October 27, 1970, Paul Avery received a Halloween card signed by \"Z\" alongside the  symbol.[56] A handwritten note read, \"Peek-a-boo, you are doomed.\" The Chronicle covered this threat on its front page.[11]:\\u200a160\\u200a The card\\'s postmark was from a San Francisco mailbox that afternoon.[57] The implication of a fourteenth Zodiac victim was speculated based on the phrase \"4-teen\" found in the card.[11]:\\u200a178\\u200a Avery refused police protection and started carrying a pistol.[58] His colleagues wore \"I Am Not Avery\" buttons.[59] Shortly after the \"Halloween Card\", Avery also received an anonymous letter about the parallels between the 1966 murder of Cheri Jo Bates and the Zodiac.[11]:\\u200a161–2\\u200a\\n\\nIn a March 13, 1971, letter to the Los Angeles Times, the Zodiac taunted police and claimed 17 victims. Zodiac expert Tom Voigt theorized that the letter\\'s postmark was a joke about an unpleasant letter coming from a town called \"Pleasanton\".[5]\\n\\nZodiac remained silent for nearly three years. The Chronicle received a letter from the Zodiac, postmarked January 29, 1974 from San Mateo County. It complained that columnist Count Marco needed to \"feel superior to everyone\" and praised The Exorcist (1973) as \"the best saterical comidy [sic] that I have ever seen.\" The letter included part of a verse from \"Tit-willow Song\" in The Mikado and an unusual symbol at the bottom that has remained unexplained. Zodiac concluded the letter with a new score, \"Me = 37, SFPD = 0.\"[16][60]\\n\\nPsychiatrist David Van Nuys theorized Zodiac stopped killing because he had multiple personality disorder. It may have lessened over time as it often can, which would also explain the reduced intensity of Zodiac\\'s letters.[61]\\n\\nMany more unconfirmed Zodiac letters were sent to the media. On August 1, 1973, a letter was mailed to the Albany Times Union in New York. The return address was the  symbol. The writer promised to kill again on August 10. A three-line code in the letter was supposed to reveal the name and location of the victim. FBI cryptanalysts deciphered the code as \"[redacted by the FBI] Albany Medical Center. This is only the beginning.\" No murder matched the details in the letter, and the handwriting was not a definitive match for Zodiac\\'s.[2]\\n\\nThe Chronicle received a letter postmarked February 14, 1974, explaining that the Symbionese Liberation Army\\'s initials spelled out an Old Norse word meaning \"kill.\" The SLA had recently kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.[2][62] The handwriting was not authenticated as the Zodiac\\'s.[63]\\n\\nA letter to the Chronicle postmarked May 8, 1974, opined that Badlands (1973) was \"murder-glorification\" and asked the paper to remove its advertisements. Signed by \"A citizen\", the handwriting, tone and sarcasm were similar to Zodiac\\'s letters. The Chronicle also received an anonymous letter postmarked July 8, 1974, complaining about antifeminist columnist Marco Spinelli. The letter was signed, \"the Red Phantom (red with rage)\".[23]:\\u200a44\\u200a\\n\\nIn 2007, an American Greetings Christmas card was discovered in the Chronicle\\'s photo files. Its postmark was from 1990 in Eureka. The card was handed over to the Vallejo police. A photocopy of two United States Post Office keys on a magnet key chain was enclosed. The handwriting on the envelope resembled Zodiac\\'s. A forensic document examiner deemed it inauthentic. The discovery electrified Zodiac researchers. It suggested the killing spree may not have been stopped by death or imprisonment and that the Zodiac might be alive.[64][65][66]\\n\\nThere is no consensus regarding the number of victims the Zodiac Killer killed or the length of his criminal spree. In 1976, SFPD detective Dave Toschi said, \"We know for sure he killed at least six\", and the Zodiac had \"a personal boxscore of 37\".[33] Robert Graysmith estimated 49 Zodiac victims.[11]:\\u200a308–11\\u200a Many murders and attacks in the 1960s and 1970s were seen as possible Zodiac crimes, but none have been confirmed.\\n\\nOn April 9, 1962, a man called the police in Oceanside, California and said, \"I am going to pull something here in Oceanside and you\\'ll never be able to figure it out.\" At 11:10\\xa0p.m. on April 10, cab driver Raymond Davis (29) told his dispatcher he was taking a fare to South Oceanside. The next day, his body was found near the mayor\\'s house in St. Malo, a gated community in Oceanside.[67][68] Days later, the suspected killer called the police again, “Do you remember me calling you last week and telling you that I was going to pull a real baffling crime? I killed the cab driver and I am going to get me a bus driver next.” The police placed armed guards on buses.[69]\\n\\nIn 2019, the unsolved murder was connected to the Zodiac when Kristi Hawthorne, the Director of the Oceanside Historical Society, was researching St. Malo for another project. She stumbled upon a story about Davis\\' murder and further research dug up several parallels to the Zodiac killings. Davis\\' murder foreshadowed Paul Stine\\'s by 7 years. Both cabbie murders involved wealthy neighborhoods. The ammunition was .22 caliber, which matches the Lake Herman Road attack. The taunting of police and the threat against buses was also followed the Zodiac.[70][67][71] Hawthorne presented her findings to the Oceanside Police Department, which began an inquiry.[69]\\n\\nOn June 2, 1963, on the beach at Tajiguas in Santa Barbara County, California, an unidentified sniper fired two shots from a .22 caliber gun at a group of teenagers. None of them were hit.[72] On June 4, on a beach within Gaviota State Park, just west of Tajiguas, Robert George Domingos (18) and his fiancée Linda Faye Edwards (17) were shot dead by an unidentified person. They were at the beach while skipping school at Lompoc High School for Senior Ditch Day.[8][73] On June 5, when the couple had not returned home, their parents called the police. During a police search, several of the couple\\'s belongings, like Edwards\\' purse, were inside Domingos\\' car.[74][75]\\n\\nPolice believed that the assailant attempted to bind the couple with pre-cut rope. This was the same modus operandi as the Lake Berryessa attacks.[8] Likely, when the victims got loose and tried to flee, the killer shot them repeatedly in the back and chest. Domingos was shot 11 times and Edwards 8 times.[74] The killer placed their bodies in a small shack nearby, and tried to burn it to the ground.[73] The firearm was probably a .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle, like the Tajiguas and Lake Herman Road incidents.[76][73] The Winchester Western Super X copper-coated bullets also matched the Zodiac\\'s.[73] The lot number of the .22 ammunition was traced to an April purchase from a store in Santa Barbara. The only other place that lot number turned up was at Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc. Investigators looked into purchases of the ammunition at both locations.[72]\\n\\nIn a 1972 press conference, Santa Barbara County Sheriff John Carpenter stated \"there now appears to be a high degree of probability\" that the Zodiac committed the murders,[77] and \"although the anticipated response to this statement would be one of skepticism, let me say that we do not make this assertion frivolously.\"[78][76] When SFPD detectives Bill Armstrong and Dave Toschi investigated the murders in 1972, Toschi said a connection is possible.[79] A classmate of Domingos and Edwards, who later became a clinical psychologist and police officer, said in 2011, \"I believe the murders were the work of the Zodiac killer, but I can\\'t prove it.\"[73]\\n\\nOn February 5, 1964, Johnny Ray Swindle and Joyce Ann Swindle (both 19), a newlywed couple from Alabama on their honeymoon, were shot while walking along Ocean Beach in San Diego. A sniper with a .22 caliber long rifle shot them five times from a nearby cliff. The killer then shot each of them once in the head at close range. Similar to the Zodiac murders, Johnny was shot behind the ear. Despite multiple bullet wounds, he remained alive for hours and died at the hospital. Joyce died almost instantly from shots to her back, left arm, and head. The killer took Joyce\\'s necklace, as well as Johnny\\'s wallet and Timex watch—the same brand watch found at the Cheri Jo Bates crime scene, and assumed to belong to Bates\\' killer.[8][70]\\n\\nJohnny\\'s mother said she could not think of him having any enemies.[80] His sister theorized the Zodiac may have been the culprit. Police investigated a 51-year-old man living in a nearby beach shack, a teenager alleged by a priest to be violent, and a 19-year-old Marine from San Diego who killed his parents and sister in Illinois. Police speculated that the Swindles were victims of a \"thrill killer\", and they also saw a parallel with the Domingos and Edwards murders.[8] In both the Santa Barbara and Ocean Beach killings, the victims were shot from a distance, then again at close range.[81] Both the Ocean Beach and Lake Herman Road murders used a .22 Remington Arms Model 550-1 rifle, but the ballistics did not match between the cartridges found at the two scenes. The San Diego Reader noted that the murders at Lake Berryessa, Santa Barbara, and Ocean Beach were all near bodies of water.[70]\\n\\nOn October 30, 1966, Cheri Jo Bates, an 18-year-old student at Riverside City College (RCC), spent the evening at the campus library annex until it closed at 9:00\\xa0p.m. Neighbors reported hearing a scream around 10:30. Her father reported her missing, and she was found dead the next morning at 6:30\\xa0a.m.[8] She was found a short distance from the library, between two abandoned houses slated to be demolished for campus renovations. She had been brutally beaten and stabbed to death. The wires in her Volkswagen\\'s distributor cap had been pulled out. A man\\'s paint-spattered Timex watch with a torn wristband was found nearby. The watch stopped at 12:24, but police believe that the attack had occurred much earlier.[82][11]:\\u200a165–6\\u200a\\n\\nOne month later, on November 29, nearly identical typewritten letters were mailed to Riverside police and the Riverside Press-Enterprise, titled \"The Confession.\" The author claimed responsibility for the Bates murder, providing details of the crime that were not released to the public. The author warned that Bates \"is not the first and she will not be the last.\"[11]:\\u200a168–9\\u200a\\n\\nIn December 1966, a macabre poem was discovered carved into the bottom side of a desktop in the RCC library. Titled \"Sick of living/unwilling to die,\" the poem\\'s language and handwriting resembled that of the Zodiac\\'s letters. It was signed with what were assumed to be a set of lowercase initials (r h) inscribed below. During the 1970 investigation, Sherwood Morrill, California\\'s top \"questioned documents\" examiner, expressed his opinion that the poem was written by the Zodiac.[11]:\\u200a170–2\\u200a\\n\\nOn March 13, 1971, five months after Avery\\'s article linking the Zodiac to the Bates murder, the Zodiac mailed a letter to the Los Angeles Times. In the letter, he credited the police, instead of Avery, for discovering his \"Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones, there are a hell of a lot more down there.\"[83] The connection between Bates and the Zodiac remains uncertain.\\n\\nOn June 8, 1967, Enedine Molina (35) and Fermin Rodriguez (36) were parked on Vallecitos Road in Alameda County. A stranger approached and told them to get out of the car. Rodriguez was fatally shot and Molina was abducted. The killer stopped near Sunol Regional Wilderness. Molina tried to escape and was killed. Rape and robbery were ruled out as motives. The murders occurred near Pleasanton. The March 1971 Zodiac letter to the Los Angeles Times was postmarked in Pleasanton.[84]\\n\\nOn February 21, 1970, John Franklin Hood (24) and his fiancée, Sandra Garcia (20), visited East Beach in Santa Barbara. The couple left their Santa Barbara home at 6 p.m. Early the following day, their fully-clothed bodies were discovered under their blanket. Hood was stabbed eleven times, mainly in the face and back. Garcia received the brunt of the vicious attack, leaving her almost unrecognizable. The bone-handled 4\" fish knife used in their murder was partially buried in the sand beneath the blanket. There appeared to be no sexual interference, and robbery was ruled out. The double-murder was similar to the 1963 killing of Domingos and Edwards, thirty miles west. It also paralleled the 1969 Lake Berryessa attack.[73][85]\\n\\nOn the night of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns (22) was driving to Petaluma with her 10-month-old daughter. Johns was also seven months pregnant.[86] She left San Bernardino at 4:30\\xa0p.m. At 11:30\\xa0p.m. on Highway 132 near Patterson, a vehicle behind her blinked its lights. A man pulled alongside and convinced her to pull over because her left rear wheel was loose. He fixed it, but when she pulled away it immediately fell off. Johns told Paul Avery that the man offered to drive her to a gas station that was in sight just up the road.[87][88][89]\\n\\nJohns asked the man if he always helped strangers this way. He replied, \"By the time I get through with them, they won\\'t need my help.\" He drove past the gas station and kept Johns captive for two hours. He told her repeatedly, \"you know I\\'m going to kill you\". When he abruptly stopped, Johns jumped out of the car with her infant and hid in an irrigation ditch. The man searched for her with a flashlight before leaving. A passing farmer drove Johns to a police station in Patterson. When she saw the Wanted poster from Paul Stine\\'s murder, she exclaimed, \"Oh my god...that\\'s him\".[87][90]:\\u200a268\\u200a Johns car was found in flames on Highway 132.[89] A few months later, the Zodiac referenced this kidnapping in a letter to the Chronicle.[91]\\n\\nAround 5:25\\xa0a.m. on June 19, 1970, SFPD Sergeant Richard Phillip \"Rich\" Radetich (25) was shot three times by a .38 caliber revolver. He was serving a parking ticket in Haight Ashbury when he was shot through the driver\\'s window of his squad car. The SFPD started assigning two officers to every patrol car. A week later, the Zodiac claimed to have shot a man \"in a parked car with a .38\". Police never found direct evidence that Zodiac killed Radetich. In 2004, the SFPD reopened the Radetich investigation.[49][92]\\n\\nRegistered nurse Donna Lass (25) was last seen on September 6, 1970, in Stateline, Nevada. She worked at the Sahara Tahoe casino until 2:00\\xa0a.m. that morning. Her boss and landlord both received phone calls from an anonymous man who claimed Lass had an illness in her family and would not be returning.[11]:\\u200a178\\u200a Her car was parked near her apartment, which was undisturbed.[93]\\n\\nPaul Avery received a Lake Tahoe postcard several months later with potential connections to Lass\\' disappearance.[94][56][90]:\\u200a274\\u200a Like the \"13-Hole Punch Card\", placed over the original image is a collage of phrases like \"Peek through the pines...around in the snow\". It also said, \"Sought Victim 12\" and included the  symbol.[95][96][23]:\\u200a43\\u200a\\n\\nIn 1986, the Placer County Sheriff\\'s Office located a skull near Emigrant Gap along California State Route 20 in the Sierra Nevada. The South Lake Tahoe Police Department began investigating a connection to the Zodiac killing spree in 2001. DNA profiling determined it was Donna Lass\\' skull in 2023.[95][97]\\n\\nThe \"Astrological Murders\" were committed by a suspected serial killer who was also active in the same region of California and around the same time as the Zodiac. Police across multiple jurisdictions made a tentative connection between a single culprit and at least a dozen unsolved homicides that occurred between the late 1960s and early 1970s. All of the victims were female and were killed in a variety of ways, including strangulation, drowning, throat-cutting and bludgeoning, occasionally after being drugged. The killings were linked because victims were dumped in ravines and killed in conjunction with astrological events, such as the winter solstice, equinox and Friday the 13th.[11]:\\u200a309,\\u200a311\\u200a\\n\\nThe Zodiac was also suspected of being the perpetrator behind the \"Santa Rosa hitchhiker murders\". Between 1972 and 1973, at least seven female hitchhikers were murdered in Sonoma County and Santa Rosa.[98]:\\u200a163\\u200a In the Zodiac\\'s January 29, 1974 \"Exorcist letter\" to the Chronicle, he claims thirty-seven victims. A symbol in that letter matched Chinese characters on a soy barrel carried by one of the Santa Rosa victims. The Zodiac had warned he would vary his modus operandi in a previous letter, \"when I comitt [sic] my murders, they shall look like routine robberies, killings of anger, + a few fake accidents, etc.\"[99]\\n\\nOne of the main Zodiac suspects, Arthur Leigh Allen, was also suspected of being the Santa Rosa killer.[100]\\n\\nIn April 2004, the SFPD cited caseload pressure and marked the Zodiac case \"inactive.\"[101] By March 2007, they reactivated the case.[102] The case remains open in Riverside and Napa County.[103][104]\\n\\nIn 2018, the Vallejo Police Department attempted to use GEDmatch to catch the Zodiac.[105] They did not receive definitive results.[106] The FBI\\'s investigation was still ongoing as of 2020.[needs update][107]\\n\\nIn 2009, The Guardian reported that the SFPD had investigated an estimated 2,500 Zodiac suspects, and only a half-dozen of them were seen as credible by the department.[108][109] Richard Grinell, who runs the website Zodiac Ciphers, stated in 2022 that \"there are probably 50 or 100 suspects named every year.\"[10]\\n\\nThe only man ever named by the police as a suspect is Arthur Leigh Allen, a former elementary school teacher and convicted sex offender who died in 1992.[6][110] Allen denied being the Zodiac.[111] He was interviewed by police from the early days of the investigation, and was subject to several related search warrants over a twenty-year period. In 2007, Graysmith said that several detectives described Allen as the most likely suspect.[112] In 2010, Toschi stated that all the evidence against Allen ultimately \"turned out to be negative.\"[113] Other suspects widely seen as viable by professional or amateur investigators include Earl Van Best Jr., Gary Francis Poste, Giuseppe Bevilacqua, Lawrence Kane, Paul Doerr, Richard Gaikowski, and Richard Marshall.[114][115][10]\\n\\nThis is the case that won\\'t go away. The killer\\'s catch-me-if-you-can taunting of police, the mind-puzzlers he sent to the press, the way he dropped off the face of the Earth in the early 1970s combined to give the Zodiac case a legendary status that in some ways outstripped the magnitude of the murders. – Michael Taylor[61]\\n\\nIn 2020, the Chronicle called the Zodiac case \"the most famous unsolved murder case in American history.\"[44] The unusual nature of the spree has sustained international interest for years.[116] A cottage industry of \"Zodiologists\" sprung up in the wake of the killings.[117] They try to solve the case and have informal annual meetings.[118][119] Several websites collect information about the crimes and ciphers.[120]\\n\\nDozens of books and documentaries have focused on the Zodiac.[9][121][122] The original and most influential amateur book was Robert Graysmith\\'s Zodiac (1986). He was working at the San Francisco Chronicle as a cartoonist while the Zodiac was corresponding with the paper. Graysmith compiled his research into an authoritative investigation that remains a touchstone for other researchers.[18]:\\u200a193\\u200a John Bowman published the book The Allen Files, containing Arthur Leigh Allen\\'s military records.[123] That was followed with, Zodiac Killer: Fact Vs. Fiction.[124]\\n\\nTheories about the Zodiac\\'s identity are rampant. In Zodiac, Graysmith refers to Arthur Leigh Allen as \"Robert Hall Starr\" to protect his identity and avoid litigation. In 2002, Graysmith wrote directly about Allen in Zodiac Unmasked.[125] Attributing victims to the Zodiac is also a popular pastime. One Zodiologist has persistently claimed to also be a target of the killer.[126] Since 2013, accusing United States Senator Ted Cruz of being the Zodiac has been a popular Internet meme.[127]\\n\\nThe Zodiac inspired copycat killers like Heriberto Seda in New York City and Shinichiro Azuma in Japan, both of whom called themselves \"the Zodiac\".[128][129] In 2021, an anonymous author sent letters to media outlets in Albany using a \"Chinese Zodiac Killer\" sobriquet.[107]\\n\\nBrian Draper and Torey Adamcik, who perpetrated the 2006 murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart, cited the Zodiac as one of their inspirations in their homemade videos.[130]\\n\\nThe first film about the Zodiac Killer was produced two years after his last confirmed murder during his letter-writing campaign. Tom Hanson\\'s The Zodiac Killer was made as a scheme to capture the culprit. The film premiered on April 19, 1971, at the Golden Gate Theater in San Francisco. The audience were given a survey with the prompt, \"I think the Zodiac kills because...\" They were asked to complete the sentence and promised the best response would be rewarded with a Kawasaki motorcycle.[131] The audience surveys were secretly compared to the Zodiac\\'s handwriting. Hanson hoped the killer\\'s supposed egotism would lure him to the movie, and deployed volunteers to detain anyone whose handwriting matched the Zodiac\\'s.[132] The scheme lasted for several screenings, and in one, the volunteers actually confronted one potential suspect and held the suspect before releasing him due to lack of evidence.[133]\\n\\nThe Zodiac has inspired villains in multiple movies, including Scorpio in Dirty Harry (1971), the Gemini Killer in The Exorcist III (1990), John Doe in Seven (1995), and the Riddler in The Batman (2022).[134] The Zodiac case is also the subject of the film Zodiac (2007), directed by David Fincher, who also directed Seven. Fincher grew up in the Bay Area during the Zodiac killings. The film was an adaptation of Robert Graysmith\\'s books,[135] focusing on Graysmith and Paul Avery\\'s investigation over 23 years.[136][108] The filmmakers extensively researched the case, conducting interviews with people involved in the case. The film posits Arthur Leigh Allen\\'s culpability and led to more public interest in the Zodiac.[76][66]\\n\\nWikimedia Commons copies of FBI file #9-HQ-49911 on the Zodiac Killer: Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\n\".'}\n"

The class of questions where an answer can be verified in polynomial time is \"NP\", standing for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\".[Note 1]\\n\\nAn answer to the P versus NP question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. If P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, which is widely believed, it would mean that there are problems in NP that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.\\n\\nThe problem has been called the most important open problem in computer science.[1] Aside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, artificial intelligence, game theory, multimedia processing, philosophy, economics and many other fields.[2]\\n\\nIt is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each of which carries a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\\n\\nConsider the following yes/no problem: given an incomplete Sudoku grid of size \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n×\\n\\nn\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n^{2}\\\\times n^{2}}\\n\\n, is there at least one legal solution where every row, column, and \\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n×\\nn\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n\\\\times n}\\n\\n square contains the integers 1 through \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n^{2}}\\n\\n? It is straightforward to verify \"yes\" instances of this generalized Sudoku problem given a candidate solution. However, it is not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can correctly answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all instances of this problem. Therefore, generalized Sudoku is in NP (quickly verifiable), but may or may not be in P (quickly solvable). (It is necessary to consider a generalized version of Sudoku, as any fixed size Sudoku has only a finite number of possible grids.  In this case the problem is in P, as the answer can be found by table lookup.)\\n\\nThe precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\"[3] (and independently by Leonid Levin in 1973[4]).\\n\\nAlthough the P versus NP problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences. In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the National Security Agency, speculating that the time required to crack a sufficiently complex code would increase exponentially with the length of the key.[5] If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical), this would imply what is now called P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, since a proposed key can be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. Gödel asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be co-NP-complete) could be solved in quadratic or linear time,[6] and pointed out one of the most important consequences—that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.\\n\\nThe relation between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, the part of the theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).\\n\\nIn such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is deterministic (given the computer\\'s present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and sequential (it performs actions one after the other).\\n\\nIn this theory, the class P consists of all decision problems (defined below) solvable on a deterministic sequential machine in a duration polynomial in the size of the input; the class NP consists of all decision problems whose positive solutions are verifiable in polynomial time given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine.[7] Clearly, P ⊆ NP. Arguably, the biggest open question in theoretical computer science concerns the relationship between those two classes:\\n\\nSince 2002, William Gasarch has conducted three polls of researchers concerning this and related questions.[8][9][10] Confidence that P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP has been increasing – in 2019, 88% believed P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, as opposed to 83% in 2012 and 61% in 2002. When restricted to experts, the 2019 answers became 99% believed P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP.[10] These polls do not imply whether P\\xa0=\\xa0NP, Gasarch himself stated: \"This does not bring us any closer to solving P=?NP or to knowing when it will be solved, but it attempts to be an objective report on the subjective opinion of this era.\"\\n\\nTo attack the P\\xa0=\\xa0NP question, the concept of NP-completeness is very useful. NP-complete problems are problems that any other NP problem is reducible to in polynomial time and whose solution is still verifiable in polynomial time. That is, any NP problem can be transformed into any NP-complete problem. Informally, an NP-complete problem is an NP problem that is at least as \"tough\" as any other problem in NP.\\n\\nNP-hard problems are those at least as hard as NP problems; i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP; i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.\\n\\nFor instance, the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete by the Cook–Levin theorem, so any instance of any problem in NP can be transformed mechanically into a Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many NP-complete problems. If any NP-complete problem is in P, then it would follow that P\\xa0=\\xa0NP. However, many important problems are NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.\\n\\nFrom the definition alone it is unintuitive that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a Turing machine M guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does a polynomial-size input that M will accept exist?[11] It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether M accepts the input by simulating M; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine M that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.\\n\\nThe first natural problem proven to be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete Latin squares in polynomial time.[12] This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning tri-partite graphs into triangles,[13] which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT,[14] which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability. So a polynomial-time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-problem in polynomial time. Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense \"the same problem\".\\n\\nAlthough it is unknown whether P\\xa0=\\xa0NP, problems outside of P are known. Just as the class P is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class EXPTIME is the set of all decision problems that have exponential running time. In other words, any problem in EXPTIME is solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in O(2p(n)) time, where p(n) is a polynomial function of n. A decision problem is EXPTIME-complete if it is in EXPTIME, and every problem in EXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. A number of problems are known to be EXPTIME-complete. Because it can be shown that P\\xa0≠\\xa0EXPTIME, these problems are outside P, and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the time hierarchy theorem, they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for chess positions on an N × N board[15] and similar problems for other board games.[16]\\n\\nThe problem of deciding the truth of a statement in Presburger arithmetic requires even more time. Fischer and Rabin proved in 1974[17] that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements of length n has a runtime of at least \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\nc\\nn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle 2^{2^{cn}}}\\n\\n for some constant c. Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the undecidable problems, such as the halting problem. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.\\n\\nIt is also possible to consider questions other than decision problems.  One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called #P: whereas an NP problem asks \"Are there any solutions?\", the corresponding #P problem asks \"How many solutions are there?\". Clearly, a #P problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some #P problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) P problems.[18] For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many. Many of these problems are #P-complete, and hence among the hardest problems in #P, since a polynomial time solution to any of them would allow a polynomial time solution to all other #P problems.\\n\\nIn 1975, Richard E. Ladner showed that if P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete.[19] Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.\\n\\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.[20] If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level.[21] Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to László Babai, runs in quasi-polynomial time.[22]\\n\\nThe integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP[23]). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP = co-NP). The most efficient known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes expected time\\n\\nto factor an n-bit integer. The best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor\\'s algorithm, runs in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\\n\\nAll of the above discussion has assumed that P means \"easy\" and \"not in P\" means \"difficult\", an assumption known as Cobham\\'s thesis. It is a common assumption in complexity theory; but there are caveats.\\n\\nFirst, it can be false in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents, rendering it impractical. For example, the problem of deciding whether a graph G contains H as a minor, where H is fixed, can be solved in a running time of O(n2),[25] where n is the number of vertices in G.  However, the big O notation hides a constant that depends superexponentially on H.  The constant is greater than \\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n↑↑\\n(\\n2\\n↑↑\\n(\\n2\\n↑↑\\n(\\nh\\n\\n/\\n\\n2\\n)\\n)\\n)\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle 2\\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow (2\\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow (2\\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow (h/2)))}\\n\\n (using Knuth\\'s up-arrow notation), and where h is the number of vertices in H.[26]\\n\\nOn the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be NP-complete, and even if P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, there may still be effective approaches to the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the knapsack problem, the traveling salesman problem, and the Boolean satisfiability problem, that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical average-case complexity (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low.  An example is the simplex algorithm in linear programming, which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case time complexity, it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.[27]\\n\\nFinally, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which P and NP are defined, such as quantum computation and randomized algorithms.\\n\\nCook provides a restatement of the problem in The P Versus NP Problem as \"Does P\\xa0=\\xa0NP?\"[28] According to polls,[8][29] most computer scientists believe that P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3,000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp\\'s 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P\\xa0=\\xa0NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP\\xa0=\\xa0co-NP and P\\xa0=\\xa0PH.\\n\\nIt is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but whose solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.[30]\\n\\nIf P = NP, then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in \"creative leaps\", no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it\\'s found.\\n—\\u200aScott Aaronson, UT Austin\\nOn the other hand, some researchers believe that it is overconfident to believe P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP and that researchers should also explore proofs of P\\xa0=\\xa0NP. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:[8]\\n\\nThe main argument in favor of P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP is the total lack of fundamental progress in the area of exhaustive search. This is, in my opinion, a very weak argument. The space of algorithms is very large and we are only at the beginning of its exploration. [...] The resolution of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem also shows that very simple questions may be settled only by very deep theories.\\n—\\u200aMoshe Y. Vardi, Rice University\\nBeing attached to a speculation is not a good guide to research planning. One should always try both directions of every problem. Prejudice has caused famous mathematicians to fail to solve famous problems whose solution was opposite to their expectations, even though they had developed all the methods required.\\n—\\u200aAnil Nerode, Cornell University\\nWhen one substitutes \"linear time on a multitape Turing machine\" for \"polynomial time\" in the definitions of P and NP, one obtains the classes DLIN and NLIN.\\nIt is known[31] that DLIN ≠ NLIN.\\n\\nOne of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the possible answers. Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.\\n\\nA proof that P\\xa0=\\xa0NP could have stunning practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in NP. The potential consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.\\n\\nIt is also very possible that a proof would not lead to practical algorithms for NP-complete problems.  The formulation of the problem does not require that the bounding polynomial be small or even specifically known. A non-constructive proof might show a solution exists without specifying either an algorithm to obtain it or a specific bound. Even if the proof is constructive, showing an explicit bounding polynomial and algorithmic details, if the polynomial is not very low-order the algorithm might not be sufficiently efficient in practice. In this case the initial proof would be mainly of interest to theoreticians, but the knowledge that polynomial time solutions are possible would surely spur research into better (and possibly practical) methods to achieve them.\\n\\nA solution showing P\\xa0=\\xa0NP could upend the field of cryptography, which relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution[Note 2] to an NP-complete problem such as 3-SAT would break most existing cryptosystems including:\\n\\nThese would need modification or replacement with information-theoretically secure solutions that do not assume P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP.\\n\\nThere are also enormous benefits that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in operations research are NP-complete, such as types of integer programming and the travelling salesman problem. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete;[35] making these problems efficiently solvable could considerably advance life sciences and biotechnology.\\n\\nThese changes could be insignificant compared to the revolution that efficiently solving NP-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. Gödel, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:[36][37]\\n\\nIf there really were a machine with φ(n) ∼ k⋅n (or even ∼ k⋅n2), this would have consequences of the greatest importance. Namely, it would obviously mean that in spite of the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, the mental work of a mathematician concerning Yes-or-No questions could be completely replaced by a machine. After all, one would simply have to choose the natural number n so large that when the machine does not deliver a result, it makes no sense to think more about the problem.\\nSimilarly, Stephen Cook (assuming not only a proof, but a practically efficient algorithm) says:[28]\\n\\n...\\xa0it would transform mathematics by allowing a computer to find a formal proof of any theorem which has a proof of a reasonable length, since formal proofs can easily be recognized in polynomial time. Example problems may well include all of the CMI prize problems.\\nResearch mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated—for instance, Fermat\\'s Last Theorem took over three centuries to prove. A method guaranteed to find a proof if a \"reasonable\" size proof exists, would essentially end this struggle.\\n\\nDonald Knuth has stated that he has come to believe that P\\xa0=\\xa0NP, but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:[38]\\n\\n[...] if you imagine a number M that\\'s finite but incredibly large—like say the number 10↑↑↑↑3 discussed in my paper on \"coping with finiteness\"—then there\\'s a humongous number of possible algorithms that do nM bitwise or addition or shift operations on n given bits, and it\\'s really hard to believe that all of those algorithms fail.\\nMy main point, however, is that I don\\'t believe that the equality P\\xa0=\\xa0NP will turn out to be helpful even if it is proved, because such a proof will almost surely be nonconstructive.\\nA proof of P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that P\\xa0=\\xa0NP, but would represent a great advance in computational complexity theory and guide future research. It would demonstrate that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.[39]\\n\\nP\\xa0≠\\xa0NP still leaves open the average-case complexity of hard problems in NP. For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. Russell Impagliazzo has described five hypothetical \"worlds\" that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question.[40] These range from \"Algorithmica\", where P\\xa0=\\xa0NP and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to \"Cryptomania\", where P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP and generating hard instances of problems outside P is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of NP-hard problems. The \"world\" where P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP but all problems in NP are tractable in the average case is called \"Heuristica\" in the paper. A Princeton University workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.[41]\\n\\nAlthough the P\\xa0=\\xa0NP problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques. In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the P\\xa0=\\xa0NP problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are insufficient for answering the question, suggesting novel technical approaches are required.\\n\\nAs additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in computational complexity theory fall into one of the following classifications, all insufficient to prove P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP:\\n\\nThese barriers are another reason why NP-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P\\xa0=\\xa0NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.\\n\\nThese barriers lead some computer scientists to suggest the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). An independence result could imply that either P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP and this is unprovable in (e.g.) ZFC, or that P\\xa0=\\xa0NP but it is unprovable in ZFC that any polynomial-time algorithms are correct.[45] However, if the problem is undecidable even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms for integer arithmetic, then nearly polynomial-time algorithms exist for all NP problems.[46] Therefore, assuming (as most complexity theorists do) some NP problems don\\'t have efficient algorithms, proofs of independence with those techniques are impossible. This also implies proving independence from PA or ZFC with current techniques is no easier than proving all NP problems have efficient algorithms.\\n\\nThe P\\xa0=\\xa0NP problem can be restated as certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in descriptive complexity.\\n\\nConsider all languages of finite structures with a fixed signature including a linear order relation. Then, all such languages in P are expressible in first-order logic with the addition of a suitable least fixed-point combinator. Recursive functions can be defined with this and the order relation. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes P.\\n\\nSimilarly, NP is the set of languages expressible in existential second-order logic—that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the polynomial hierarchy, PH, correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question \"is P a proper subset of NP\" can be reformulated as \"is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?\".[47] The word \"existential\" can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since P\\xa0=\\xa0NP if and only if P\\xa0=\\xa0PH (as the former would establish that NP\\xa0=\\xa0co-NP, which in turn implies that NP\\xa0=\\xa0PH).\\n\\nNo known algorithm for a NP-complete problem runs in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for NP-complete problems that if P\\xa0=\\xa0NP, the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to Levin (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if P\\xa0=\\xa0NP:\\n\\nThis is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an NP-complete language only if P\\xa0=\\xa0NP. \"Accepting\" means it gives \"yes\" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is \"no\" (also known as a semi-algorithm).\\n\\nThis algorithm is enormously impractical, even if P\\xa0=\\xa0NP. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is b bits long, the above algorithm will try at least 2b − 1 other programs first.\\n\\nA decision problem is a problem that takes as input some string w over an alphabet Σ, and outputs \"yes\" or \"no\". If there is an algorithm (say a Turing machine, or a computer program with unbounded memory) that produces the correct answer for any input string of length n in at most cnk steps, where k and c are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in polynomial time and we place it in the class P. Formally, P is the set of languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. Meaning,\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nand a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine M that satisfies two conditions:\\n\\nNP can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach uses the concept of certificate and verifier. Formally, NP is the set of languages with a finite alphabet and verifier that runs in polynomial time. The following defines a \"verifier\":\\n\\nLet L be a language over a finite alphabet, Σ.\\n\\nL ∈ NP if, and only if, there exists a binary relation \\n\\n\\n\\nR\\n⊂\\n\\nΣ\\n\\n∗\\n\\n\\n×\\n\\nΣ\\n\\n∗\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle R\\\\subset \\\\Sigma ^{*}\\\\times \\\\Sigma ^{*}}\\n\\n and a positive integer k such that the following two conditions are satisfied:\\n\\nA Turing machine that decides LR is called a verifier for L and a y such that (x, y) ∈ R is called a certificate of membership of x in L.\\n\\nNot all verifiers must be polynomial-time. However, for L to be in NP, there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.\\n\\nLet\\n\\nWhether a value of x is composite is equivalent to of whether x is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE ∈ NP by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).\\n\\nCOMPOSITE also happens to be in P, a fact demonstrated by the invention of the AKS primality test.[48]\\n\\nThere are many equivalent ways of describing NP-completeness.\\n\\nLet L be a language over a finite alphabet Σ.\\n\\nL is NP-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\\n\\nAlternatively, if L ∈ NP, and there is another NP-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to L, then L is NP-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is NP-complete.\\n\\nWhile the P versus NP problem is generally considered unsolved,[49] many amateur and some professional researchers have claimed solutions. Gerhard J. Woeginger compiled a list of 116 purported proofs from 1986 to 2016, of which 61 were proofs of P\\xa0=\\xa0NP, 49 were proofs of P\\xa0≠\\xa0NP, and 6 proved other results, e.g. that the problem is undecidable.[50] Some attempts at resolving P versus NP have received brief media attention,[51] though these attempts have been refuted.\\n\\nThe film Travelling Salesman, by director Timothy Lanzone, is the story of four mathematicians hired by the US government to solve the P versus NP problem.[52]\\n\\nIn the sixth episode of The Simpsons\\' seventh season \"Treehouse of Horror VI\", the equation P\\xa0=\\xa0NP is seen shortly after Homer accidentally stumbles into the \"third dimension\".[53][54]\\n\\nIn the second episode of season 2 of Elementary, \"Solve for X\" Holmes and Watson investigate the murders of mathematicians who were attempting to solve P versus NP.[55][56]\\n\".'}\n"

It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting and calisthenics.\\n\\nIn competitive bodybuilding, competitors appear onstage in line-ups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on conditioning, muscularity, posing, size, stage presentation, and symmetry.[2] Bodybuilders prepare for competitions by exercising and eliminating non-essential body fat. This is enhanced at the final stage by a combination of carbohydrate loading and dehydration to achieve maximum muscle definition and vascularity. Most bodybuilders also tan and shave their bodies prior to competition.[3]\\n\\nBodybuilding requires significant time and effort to reach the desired results. A novice bodybuilder may be able to gain 8–15 pounds (4–7\\xa0kg) of muscle per year if they lift weights for seven hours per week, but muscle gains begin to slow down after the first two years to about 5–15 pounds (2–7\\xa0kg) per year. After five years, gains can decrease to as little as 3–10 pounds (1–5\\xa0kg) per year.[4] Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries faster. However, using performance-enhancing drugs can have serious health risks.[5] Furthermore, most competitions prohibit the use of these substances. Despite some calls for drug testing to be implemented, the National Physique Committee (considered the leading amateur bodybuilding federation) does not require testing.[6]\\n\\nThe winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is recognized as the world\\'s top male professional bodybuilder. Since 1950, the NABBA Universe Championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners including Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, Steve Reeves, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\n\\nStone-lifting competitions were practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Tamilakam.[7]\\n\\nWestern weightlifting developed in Europe from 1880 to 1953, with strongmen displaying feats of strength for the public and challenging each other. The focus was not on their physique, and they possessed relatively large bellies and fatty limbs compared to bodybuilders of today.[8]\\n\\nBodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by Eugen Sandow. He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in \"muscle display performances\". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld. The Oscar-winning 1936 musical film The Great Ziegfeld depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.[9]\\n\\nSandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined dumbbells, spring pulleys, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"cabinet cards\" and other prints.\\n\\nSandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\". It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[10] Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming number of audience members. The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of Nottingham. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy—now the most famous of all—was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe.[11] In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to Steve Reeves for winning the inaugural NABBA Mr. Universe contest. It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the IFBB Mr. Olympia contest, Frank Zane, was presented with a replica of the bronze trophy. Since then, Mr. Olympia winners have been consistently awarded a replica of the bronze Sandow.\\n\\nThe first large-scale bodybuilding competition in America took place from December 28, 1903, to January 2, 1904,[12] at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The competition was promoted by Bernarr Macfadden, the father of physical culture and publisher of original bodybuilding magazines such as Health & Strength. The winner was Al Treloar, who was declared \"The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World\".[13] Treloar won a thousand dollar cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, Thomas Edison made a film of Treloar\\'s posing routine. Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and Charles Atlas continued to promote bodybuilding across the world.\\n\\nMany other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include: Earle Liederman (writer of some of bodybuilding\\'s earliest books), Zishe Breitbart, George Hackenschmidt, Emy Nkemena, George F. Jowett, Finn Hateral (a pioneer in the art of posing)[citation needed], Frank Saldo, Monte Saldo, William Bankier, Launceston Elliot, Sig Klein, Sgt. Alfred Moss, Joe Nordquist, Lionel Strongfort (\"Strongfortism\"),[14] Gustav Frištenský, Ralph Parcaut (a champion wrestler who also authored an early book on \"physical culture\"), and Alan P. Mead (who became a muscle champion despite the fact that he lost a leg in World War I). Actor Francis X. Bushman, who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor\\'s model before beginning his famous silent movie career.[15]\\n\\nBodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and gymnastics champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for bulking up and cutting down, the use of protein and other food supplements, and the opportunity to enter physique contests. The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, and most notably the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) was founded in 1946 by Canadian brothers Joe and Ben Weider. Other bodybuilding organizations included the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many \"Mr. XXX\" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles[according to whom?] were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world.[1]\\n\\nDuring the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders were Bill Pearl, Reg Park, Leroy Colbert, and Clarence Ross.[16] Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as cinema. The most notable were Jack LaLanne, Steve Reeves, Reg Park, and Mickey Hargitay.[17] While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince\\'s Gym in North Hollywood, California and Vic Tanny\\'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of Gold\\'s Gym in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed Muscle Beach in Santa Monica continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The movement grew more in the 1960s with increased TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were typecast in popular shows and movies.[7]\\n\\nIn the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu, Lou Ferrigno, Mike Mentzer and others in the 1977 docudrama Pumping Iron. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) took a back seat. The National Physique Committee (NPC) was formed in 1981 by Jim Manion,[18] who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in the United States and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.\\n\\nThis period also saw the rise of anabolic steroids in bodybuilding and many other sports. More significant use began with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sergio Oliva, and Lou Ferrigno in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with Lee Haney, the 1990s with Dorian Yates, Ronnie Coleman, and Markus Rühl, and up to the present day. Bodybuilders such as Greg Kovacs attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like Tom Platz or Paul Demayo for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting Pumping Iron, Schwarzenegger, while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement, said, \"You have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".[citation needed] He would later say that he did not regret using steroids.[19]\\n\\nTo combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the IOC, the IFBB introduced doping tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.[20] In the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of 1990, U.S. Congress placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In Canada, steroids are listed under Schedule IV of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, enacted by the federal Parliament in 1996.[21]\\n\\nIn 1990, professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon attempted to form his own bodybuilding organization known as the World Bodybuilding Federation (WBF). It operated as a sister to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), which provided cross-promotion via its performers and personalities. Tom Platz served as the WBF\\'s director of talent development, and announced the new organization during an ambush of that year\\'s Mr. Olympia (which, unbeknownst to organizers, McMahon and Platz had attended as representatives of an accompanying magazine, Bodybuilding Lifestyles). It touted efforts to bring bigger prize money and more \"dramatic\" events to the sport of bodybuilding—which resulted in its championships being held as pay-per-view events with WWF-inspired sports entertainment features and showmanship. The organization signed high-valued contracts with a number of IFBB regulars.[22][23][24]\\n\\nThe IFBB\\'s inaugural championship in June 1991 (won by Gary Strydom) received mixed reviews. The WBF would be indirectly impacted by a steroid scandal involving the WWF, prompting the organization to impose a drug testing policy prior to the 1992 championship. The drug testing policy hampered the quality of the 1992 championship, while attempts to increase interest by hiring WCW wrestler Lex Luger as a figurehead (hosting a WBF television program on USA Network, and planning to make a guest pose during the 1992 championship before being injured in a motorcycle accident) and attempting to sign Lou Ferrigno (who left the organization shortly after the drug testing policy was announced) did not come to fruition. The second PPV received a minuscule audience, and the WBF dissolved only one month later in July 1992.[22][23][24]\\n\\nIn 2003, Joe Weider sold Weider Publications to American Media, Inc. (AMI). The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of Ben Weider in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest: in 2017 AMI took the contest outright.[25]\\n\\nIn the early 21st century, patterns of consumption and recreation similar to those of the United States became more widespread in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union. This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former Eastern Bloc states.[26][self-published source?]\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an Olympic sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.[27]\\n\\nThe advent of social media had a profound influence on fitness and bodybuilding. It is common to see platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube flooded with fitness-related content, changing how the average person views and interacts with fitness culture. Gym clothing brands like Gymshark, YoungLA and Rawgear leveraged this platform to create their brands.[28] By recruiting fitness ambassadors—real people who embody their brand values—these companies personalize their marketing strategy and create a more relatable image. These ambassadors, often in the form of fitness influencers or personal trainers, promote the brand by sharing their workout routines, dietary plans, and gym clothing. YouTube in particular has seen a surge in fitness content, ranging from gym vlogs to detailed discussions on workout attire. This not only provides consumers with an abundance of free resources to aid their fitness journey, but also creates a more informed consumer base.\\n\\nAnother growing trend with gym-related social media is the phenomenon of gym-shaming; a video posted by content creator Jessica Fernandez on Twitch that went viral showed her lifting weights in a gym while a man in the background stared at her, sparking a widespread debate about narcissism and an increasingly toxic gym culture in the age of social media. The video led to criticism of an emerging trend in which gyms, once known as places for focused workouts, are now being treated as filming locations for aspiring or established influencers with bystanders being unintentionally placed under the public eye in the process. Bodybuilder Joey Swoll, who voiced his concerns over this culture, addressed the controversy by stating that while harassment in gyms needs to be addressed, the man in Fernandez\\'s video was not guilty of it.[29] Although social media is giving more attention to the world of bodybuilding, there are still some areas that are controversial.\\n\\nFor instance, concerns are growing over the influence which bodybuilding content on social media has on young adults and their perception of their own bodies, as they tend to compare themselves to gym influencers online. These concerns get further exacerbated by the poor transparency about steroid use on social media, as many influencers either do not elaborate about whether or not they are \"natural\" bodybuilders, or firmly deny accusations about being \"enhanced\". This blurs the line between what can be achieved naturally and what can only be achieved through the use of anabolic steroids. This is also detrimental for adult lifters since they often find their body image being skewed by the content they consume, potentially leading to an unhealthy relationship towards nutrition and exercise. Mental disorders such as body dysmorphia or eating disorders might also be a consequence. However, more and more influencers are opening up about steroid use and strongly advocate for transparency about steroid use online. This has sparked an ongoing open debate about the risks of anabolic steroids. Many people view this as a positive trend as it raises awareness and educates about the effects, uses and dangers of steroids. Another topic which is now widely discussed online is mental health in association with bodybuilding, as aforementioned mental disorders might affect hobby lifters of all ages and backgrounds.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"professional\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.[30] Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.\\n\\nDue to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.[31]\\n\\nIn natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from lie detectors to urinalysis. Penalties range from organization to organization, from suspensions to strict bans from competition. Natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization\\'s website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.[31]\\n\\nDue to those who found open-bodybuilding to be \"too big\" or \"ugly\" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013.[32] The first Men\\'s Physique Olympia winner was Mark Wingson, who was followed by Jeremy Buendia for four consecutive years. Like open-bodybuilding, the federations in which bodybuilders can compete are natural divisions as well as normal ones. The main difference between the two is that men\\'s physique competitors pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit and open-bodybuilders are much larger and are more muscular than the men\\'s physique competitors.[33] Open-bodybuilders have an extensive routine for posing while the Physique category is primarily judged by the front and back poses.[34] Many of the men\\'s physique competitors are not above 200 lbs and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to open-bodybuilders.[35] Although this category started off slowly, it has grown tremendously, and currently men\\'s physique seems to be a more popular class than open-bodybuilding.[36]\\n\\nThis is the middle ground of Men\\'s Physique and Bodybuilding, a category that emphasizes symmetry, proportion, pleasing lines, and a small waist over size and mass.[37] The competitors in this category are not nearly as big as Open class bodybuilders but not as small as Men\\'s Physique competitors. They pose and perform in men\\'s boxer briefs or posing trunks to show off the legs as in the Open class, unlike Men\\'s Physique which hide the legs in board shorts. The judging criteria also looks to see certain poses emphasized, such as ones accentuating the vacuum to illustrate a tapered torso and lack of the infamous bloated gut of Open bodybuilding.\\n\\nThe Classic Physique division in Mr. Olympia began in 2016. Danny Hester was the first classic physique Mr. Olympia. As of 2024[update], Chris Bumstead is the 6x reigning Mr. Olympia.[38][39]\\n\\nThe female movement of the 1960s, combined with Title IX and the all around fitness revolution, gave birth to new alternative perspectives of feminine beauty that included an athletic physique of toned muscle. This athletic physique was found in various popular media outlets such as fashion magazines. Female bodybuilders changed the limits of traditional femininity as their bodies showed that muscles are not only just for men.[40]\\n\\nThe first U.S. Women\\'s National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in 1978 in Canton, Ohio, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest—that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.[41] In 1980, the first Ms. Olympia (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was Rachel McLish, who had also won the NPC\\'s USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding.\\n\\nIn 1985, the documentary Pumping Iron II: The Women was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 Caesars Palace World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, Bev Francis, and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a powerlifter, though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.[42]\\n\\nThe related areas of fitness and figure competition increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder.[citation needed][43]\\n\\nE. Wilma Conner competed in the 2011 NPC Armbrust Pro Gym Warrior Classic Championships in Loveland, Colorado, at the age of 75 years and 349 days.[44]\\n\\nIn competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders aspire to present an \"aesthetically pleasing\" body on stage.[45][46] In prejudging, competitors do a series of mandatory poses: the front lat spread, rear lat spread, front double biceps, back double biceps, side chest, side triceps, Most Muscular (men only), abdominals and thighs. Each competitor also performs a personal choreographed routine to display their physique. A posedown is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders are advised to spend a lot of time practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach.[47]\\n\\nIn contrast to strongman or powerlifting competitions, where physical strength is paramount, or to Olympic weightlifting, where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.[48]\\n\\nThe general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12–14 weeks from competition, lose a maximum of body fat (referred to as \"cutting\") while preserving as much muscular mass as possible. The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance (calorie surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person\\'s goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one\\'s energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of anabolism.[49]\\n\\nThe cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to oxidize fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.[50]\\n\\nThe bulking and cutting strategy is considered effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance.[51] A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions. Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much lean mass as possible.[citation needed] However, it is unclear whether one can maintain enough fat-free mass during cutting for the overall process to be worth it.[52][53]\\n\\nThe attempt to increase muscle mass in one\\'s body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\".[54] Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high is to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a low amount of fats.[55] To maintain a clean bulk, it is important to reach calorie goals every day. Macronutrient goals (carbs, fats, and proteins) will be different for each person, but it is ideal to get as close as possible.[citation needed]\\n\\n\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a massive caloric surplus without trying to figure out the exact amount of ingested macronutrients, often down with junk food such as burgers and fries. Weightlifters who attempt to gain mass quickly with no aesthetic concerns often choose to do this. \"Dirty bulking\" is often favored by bodybuilders in the off-season who are looking to rapidly increase size and strength without worrying about fat gain. While it can lead to quick weight gain and increased muscle mass due to the abundance of calories, it also typically results in a significant increase in body fat. This means a more aggressive cutting phase is usually required afterward to shed the excess fat, which can be physically and mentally taxing. Additionally, consuming large amounts of processed foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats can negatively impact cardiovascular health and insulin sensitivity over time. Despite these risks, some lifters find dirty bulking psychologically easier, as it removes the pressure of strict meal planning and food tracking.[56]\\n\\nBodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize muscle hypertrophy:\\n\\nIntensive weight training causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as microtrauma. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). It is the repair of these micro-traumas that results in muscle growth. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.[58]\\n\\nWeight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.[59] In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles (compared to what happens if that same individual does not lift weights at all), although the emphasis is different.[59]\\n\\nThe high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more calories than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. In preparation of a contest, a sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with cardiovascular exercise to lose body fat. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the three major macronutrients that the human body needs to build muscle.[60] The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.[61]\\n\\nCarbohydrates play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of insulin, a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis.[62] Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains.[63] It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein—which also induces the release of insulin—it is impossible to add muscle mass.[64] Bodybuilders seek out low-glycemic polysaccharides and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-glycemic sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure dextrose or maltodextrin) just before, during, and/or just after a workout. This may help to replenish glycogen stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.[65]\\n\\nThe motor proteins actin and myosin generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles. Cortisol decreases amino acid uptake by muscle and inhibits protein synthesis.[66] Current recommendations suggest that bodybuilders should consume 25–30% of protein per total calorie intake to further their goal of maintaining and improving their body composition.[67] This is a widely debated topic, with many arguing that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day is ideal, some suggesting that less is sufficient, while others recommending 1.5, 2, or more.[68] It is believed that protein needs to be consumed frequently throughout the day, especially during/after a workout, and before sleep.[69] There is also some debate concerning the best type of protein to take. Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. Casein or whey are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high biological value (BV) and quick absorption rates. Whey protein also has a bigger effect than casein on insulin levels, triggering about double the amount of insulin release.[70] That effect is somewhat overcome by combining casein and whey.\\n\\nBodybuilders were previously thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of soy, which was additionally avoided due to its alleged estrogenic (female hormone) properties, though more recent studies have shown that soy actually contains phytoestrogens which compete with estrogens in the male body and can block estrogenic actions.[71] Soy, flax, and other plant-based foods that contain phytoestrogens are also beneficial because they can inhibit some pituitary functions while stimulating the liver\\'s P450 system (which eliminates hormones, drugs, and waste from the body) to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen.[72]\\n\\nSome bodybuilders often split their food intake into 5 to 7 meals of equal nutritional content and eat at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 to 3 hours). This approach serves two purposes: to limit overindulging in the cutting phase, and to allow for the consumption of large volumes of food during the bulking phase. Eating more frequently does not increase basal metabolic rate when compared to 3 meals a day.[73] While food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called the thermic effect of food, it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across the meals of the day. Well-controlled studies using whole-body calorimetry and doubly labeled water have demonstrated that there is no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently.[74][75][76]\\n\\nThe important role of nutrition in building muscle and losing fat means bodybuilders may consume a wide variety of dietary supplements.[77] Various products are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase the rate of fat loss, improve joint health, increase natural testosterone production, enhance training performance and prevent potential nutrient deficiencies.\\n\\nSome bodybuilders use drugs such as anabolic steroids and precursor substances such as prohormones to increase muscle hypertrophy. Anabolic steroids cause hypertrophy of both types (I and II) of muscle fibers, likely caused by an increased synthesis of muscle proteins. They also provoke undesired side effects including hepatotoxicity, gynecomastia, acne, the early onset of male pattern baldness and a decline in the body\\'s own testosterone production, which can cause testicular atrophy.[78][79][80] Other performance-enhancing substances used by competitive bodybuilders include human growth hormone (HGH). HGH is also used by female bodybuilders to obtain bigger muscles \"while maintaining a \\'female appearance\\'\".[81]\\n\\nMuscle growth is more difficult to achieve in older adults than younger adults because of biological aging, which leads to many metabolic changes detrimental to muscle growth; for instance, by diminishing growth hormone and testosterone levels. Some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose HGH treatment for adults with HGH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing muscle mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing bone density and muscle strength, improves cardiovascular parameters, and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.[82][83][84]\\n\\nIn rodents, knockdown of metallothionein gene expression results in activation of the Akt pathway and increases in myotube size, in type IIb fiber hypertrophy, and ultimately in muscle strength.[85] This has not been studied well in humans.\\n\\nSome bodybuilders inject oils or other compounds into their muscles (sometimes known as \"synthol\") to enhance their size or appearance. This practice can have serious health consequences and risks for humans.[86]\\n\\nAlthough muscle stimulation occurs when lifting weights, muscle growth occurs during rest periods for up to 48 hours after the workout.[87][88] Some bodybuilders add a massage at the end of each workout to their routine as a method of recovering.[89]\\n\\nOvertraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where their workload exceeds their recovery capacity. There are many reasons why overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) and can result in a hyperadrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.[90] To avoid overtraining, intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery. Timely provision of carbohydrates, proteins, and various micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are critical. A mental disorder, informally called bigorexia (by analogy with anorexia), may account for overtraining in some individuals. Sufferers feel as if they are never big enough or muscular enough, which forces them to overtrain to try to reach their goal physique.[91]\\n\\nAn article by Muscle & Fitness magazine, \"Overtrain for Big Gains\", claimed that overtraining for a brief period can be beneficial. Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase. These are known as \"shock micro-cycles\" and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes.[92]\\n\\nBeginning in the 2010s, studies on bodybuilding athletes found higher mortality rates, particularly when compared with other sport specific mortality rates. Risks cited were sudden cardiac death, as well as use of performance enhancing drugs and unique competitive training, such as extreme weight changes and intentional dehydration. Unlike other professional sports, the IFBB Pro League, the largest professional bodybuilding federation in the US, does not routinely test athletes for steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs and there is no athletes\\' union. Bodybuilders say steroids are easily obtained and widely used by competitors.[93][94][95]\\n\".'}\n"

In 2023, it was ranked 31st on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world\\'s largest public companies.[16] As of 2022, it was the world\\'s third-largest spender on research and development, with R&D expenses totaling US$35.3 billion.[17]\\n\\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[18] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[19] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain 22% of the total shares and 57% of the total voting power in Facebook.[20]\\n\\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation yet for a newly public company.[21] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[22] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Mobility and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald\\'s, Disney, and Kraft Foods—and made Zuckerberg\\'s stock worth $19 billion.[23][24] The New York Times stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook\\'s difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[23] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That\\'s a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[25]\\n\\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[26] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[27] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[28] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[29] The stock set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[30] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[31]\\n\\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street\\'s Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[32] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[33] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[34] S&P Global Ratings added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[35]\\n\\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[36][37] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg\\'s \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in Business Insider, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[38]\\n\\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[39][40][41]\\n\\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead Jason Rubin sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook\\'s leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook\\'s virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players\\' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[42]\\n\\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[43] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[44] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[45] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from Swiss government regulators and the public.[46][47]\\n\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services, including Facebook, grew globally.[48] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic. Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[48]\\n\\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021 about Facebook\\'s plan to rebrand the company and change its name.[12][49] In the Q3 2021 earnings call on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company\\'s social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[50] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[13] Based on Facebook\\'s PR campaign, the name change reflects the company\\'s shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[13][51]\\n\\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[52] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[53] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, thus it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and the previous project would end in 2022.[54]\\n\\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[55] It reported no growth in monthly users,[56] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[55] It also expected measures taken by Apple Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[57] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[58]\\n\\nThe 27% reduction in the company\\'s share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta\\'s market capitalization.[56] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[56] Zuckerberg\\'s net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[59] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[60][61]\\n\\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[62] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a “more traditional” role.[63]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to the Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia and hate speech (up to genocidal calls) amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[64] Meta appealed against the ban, but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[64]\\n\\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[65][66][67]\\n\\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[68] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple\\'s app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[69][70][71] On October 27, 2022, Meta\\'s market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[72]\\n\\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta\\'s investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[73] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[74] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[75][76]\\n\\nStarting from 2022, Meta scrambled to catch up to other tech companies in adopting specialized artificial intelligence hardware and software. It had been using less expensive CPUs instead of GPUs for AI work, but that approach turned out to be less efficient.[77] The company gifted the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research $1.3 million to finance the Social Media Archive\\'s aim to make their data available to social science research.[78]\\n\\nIn 2023, Ireland\\'s Data Protection Commissioner imposed a record EUR 1.2 billion fine on Meta for transferring data from Europe to the United States without adequate protections for EU citizens.[79]:\\u200a250\\u200a\\n\\nIn March 2023, Meta announced a new round of layoffs that would cut 10,000 employees and close 5,000 open positions to make the company more efficient.[80] Meta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[81] On July 6, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[82]\\n\\nMeta announced its artificial intelligence model Llama 2 in July 2023, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. It was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta\\'s generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[83][84]\\n\\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the Online News Act, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act was in effect by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[85] In October 2023, Zuckerberg said that AI would be Meta\\'s biggest investment area in 2024.[86] Meta finished 2023 as one of the best-performing technology stocks of the year, with its share price up 150 percent.[87] Its stock reached an all-time high in January 2024, bringing Meta within 2% of achieving $1 trillion market capitalization.[88]\\n\\nIn November 2023 Meta Platforms launched an ad-free service in Europe, allowing subscribers to opt-out of personal data being collected for targeted advertising. A group of 28 European organizations, including Max Schrems\\' advocacy group NOYB, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Wikimedia Europe, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, signed a 2024 letter to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) expressing concern that this subscriber model would undermine privacy protections, specifically GDPR data protection standards.[89]\\n\\nMeta removed the Facebook and Instagram accounts of Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in February 2024, citing repeated violations of its Dangerous Organizations & Individuals policy.[90] As of March, Meta was under investigation by the FDA for alleged use of their social media platforms to sell illegal drugs.[91] On 16 May 2024, the European Commission began an investigation into Meta over concerns related to child safety.[92][93][94][95]\\n\\nIn May 2023, Iraqi social media influencer Esaa Ahmed-Adnan encountered a troubling issue when Instagram removed his posts, citing false copyright violations despite his content being original and free from copyrighted material. He discovered that extortionists were behind these takedowns, offering to restore his content for $3,000 or provide ongoing protection for $1,000 per month. This scam, exploiting Meta’s rights management tools, became widespread in the Middle East, revealing a gap in Meta’s enforcement in developing regions. An Iraqi nonprofit Tech4Peace’s founder, Aws al-Saadi helped Ahmed-Adnan and others, but the restoration process was slow, leading to significant financial losses for many victims, including prominent figures like Ammar al-Hakim. This situation highlighted Meta’s challenges in balancing global growth with effective content moderation and protection.[96]\\n\\nOn 16 September 2024, Meta announced it had banned Russian state media outlets from its platforms worldwide due to concerns about \"foreign interference activity.\" This decision followed allegations that RT and its employees funneled $10 million through shell companies to secretly fund influence campaigns on various social media channels. Meta\\'s actions were part of a broader effort to counter Russian covert influence operations, which had intensified since the invasion.[97]\\n\\nAt its 2024 Connect conference, Meta presented Orion,[98] its first pair of augmented reality glasses. Though Orion was originally intended to be sold to consumers, the manufacturing process turned out to be too complex and expensive.[99] Instead, the company pivoted to producing a small number of the glasses to be used internally.[100]\\n\\nOn 4 October 2024, Meta announced about its new AI model called Movie Gen, capable of generating realistic video and audio clips based on user prompts. Meta stated it would not release Movie Gen for open development, preferring to collaborate directly with content creators and integrate it into its products by the following year. The model was built using a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets.[101]\\n\\nOn October 31, 2024, ProPublica published an investigation into deceptive political advertisement scams that sometimes use hundreds of hijacked profiles and facebook pages run by organized networks of scammers. The authors cited spotty enforcement by Meta as a major reason for the extent of the issue.[102]\\n\\nIn November 2024, TechCrunch reported that Meta were considering building a $10bn global underwater cable spanning 25,000 miles.[103]\\n\\nIn the same month, Meta closed down 2 million accounts on Facebook and Instagram that were linked to scam centers in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates doing pig butchering scams.[104]\\n\\nIn December 2024, Meta announced that, beginning February 2025, they would require advertisers to run ads about financial services in Australia to verify information about who are the beneficiary and the payer in a bid to regulate scams.[105]\\n\\nOn December 4, 2024, Meta announced it will invest US$10 billion for its largest AI data center in northeast Louisiana, powered by natural gas facilities.[106]\\n\\nOn the 11th of that month, Meta experienced a global outage, impacting accounts on all of their social media and messaging applications. Outage reports from DownDetector reached 70,000+ and 100,000+ within minutes for Instagram and Facebook, respectively.[107]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Meta announced plans to roll back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, citing shifts in the \"legal and policy landscape\" in the United States following the 2024 presidential election. The decision followed reports that CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to align the company more closely with the incoming Trump administration, including changes to content moderation policies and executive leadership.[108]  The new content moderation policies continued to  bar insults about a person\\'s intellect or mental illness, but made an exception to allow calling LGBTQ people mentally ill because they are gay or transgender.[109]  Later that month, Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit brought by Donald Trump for suspending his social media accounts after the January 6 riots.[110] Changes to Meta\\'s moderation policies were controversial among its oversight board, with a significant divide in opinion between the board\\'s US conservatives and its global members.[111]\\n\\nIn June 2025, Meta Platforms Inc. has decided to make a multibillion-dollar investment into artificial intelligence startup Scale AI. The financing could exceed $10 billion in value which would make it one of the largest private company funding events of all time.[112]\\n\\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[113] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[114] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[115][116] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[117][118] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[119] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year\\'s most popular VR games, Beat Saber.[120] In Late 2022, after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\\n\\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[121] However, in August 2021, UK\\'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[122] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[123] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[124] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53\\xa0million.[125]\\n\\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[126] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[127]\\n\\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[128]\\n\\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. In 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[129] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[130] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[131]\\n\\nIn December 2024, Meta donated $1 million to the inauguration fund for then-President-elect Donald Trump.[132]\\n\\nIn August 2024, Mark Zuckerberg sent a letter to Jim Jordan indicating that during the COVID-19 pandemic the Biden administration repeatedly asked Meta to limit certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, on Facebook and Instagram.[133]\\n\\nIn 2016 Meta hired Jordana Cutler, formerly an employee at the Israeli Embassy to the United States, as its policy chief for Israel and the Jewish Diaspora. In this role, Cutler pushed for the censorship of accounts belonging to Students for Justice in Palestine chapters in the United States. Critics have said that Cutler\\'s position gives the Israeli government an undue influence over Meta policy, and that few countries have such high levels of contact with Meta policymakers.[134]\\n\\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump in 2025, various sources noted possible censorship related to the Democratic Party on Instagram and other Meta platforms.[135][136][137] In February 2025, a Meta rep flagged journalist Gil Duran\\'s article and other \"critiques of tech industry figures\" as spam or sensitive content, limiting their reach.[138]\\n\\nIn March 2025, Meta attempted to block former employee Sarah Wynn-Williams from promoting or further distributing her memoir, Careless People, that includes allegations of unaddressed sexual harassment in the workplace by senior executives. The New York Times reports that the arbitration is among Meta\\'s most forcible attempts to repudiate a former employee\\'s account of workplace dynamics.[139]  Publisher Macmillan reacted to the ruling by the Emergency International Arbitral Tribunal by stating that it will ignore its provisions.[140]  As of 15\\xa0March\\xa02025[update], hardback and digital versions of Careless People were being offered for sale by major online retailers.\\n\\nSince its inception, Meta has been accused of being a host for fake news and misinformation.[141] In the wake of the 2016 United States presidential election, Zuckerberg began to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news, as the platform had been criticized for its potential influence on the outcome of the election.[142] The company initially partnered with ABC News, the Associated Press, FactCheck.org, Snopes and PolitiFact for its fact-checking initiative;[143] as of 2018, it had over 40 fact-checking partners across the world, including The Weekly Standard.[144]\\n\\nA May 2017 review by The Guardian found that the platform\\'s fact-checking initiatives of partnering with third-party fact-checkers and publicly flagging fake news were regularly ineffective, and appeared to be having minimal impact in some cases.[145] In 2018, journalists working as fact-checkers for the company criticized the partnership, stating that it had produced minimal results and that the company had ignored their concerns.[144]\\n\\nIn 2024 Meta\\'s decision to continue to disseminate a falsified video of US president Joe Biden, even after it had been proven to be fake, attracted criticism and concern.[146][147]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Meta ended its use of third-party fact-checkers in favor of a user-run community notes system similar to the one used on X.[148][149]\\n\\nWhile Zuckerberg supported these changes, saying that the amount of censorship on the platform was excessive, the decision received criticism by fact-checking institutions, stating that the changes would make it more difficult for users to identify misinformation.[150] Meta also faced criticism for weakening its policies on hate speech that were designed to protect minorities and LGBTQ+ individuals from bullying and discrimination.[151][152][153] While moving its content review teams from California to Texas, Meta changed their hateful conduct policy to eliminate restrictions on anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant hate speech, as well as explicitly allowing users to accuse LGBT people of being mentally ill or abnormal based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.[154][155][156][157]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Meta faced significant criticism for its role in removing LGBTQ+ content from its platforms, amid its broader efforts to address anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech. The removal of LGBTQ+ themes was noted as part of the wider crackdown on content deemed to violate its community guidelines. Meta\\'s content moderation policies, which were designed to combat harmful speech and protect users from discrimination, inadvertently led to the removal or restriction of LGBTQ+ content, particularly posts highlighting LGBTQ+ identities, support, or political issues. According to reports, LGBTQ+ posts, including those that simply celebrated pride or advocated for LGBTQ+ rights, were flagged and removed for reasons that some critics argue were vague or inconsistently applied. Many LGBTQ+ activists and users on Meta\\'s platforms expressed concern that such actions stifled visibility and expression, potentially isolating LGBTQ+ individuals and communities, especially in spaces that were historically important for outreach and support.[151][153][152]\\n\\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[158]\\n\\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook\\'s acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the U.S. social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[159] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[160]\\n\\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company\\'s annual revenue in the country.[161]\\n\\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[162][163]\\n\\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the U.S. over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee\\'s testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children\\'s activity on Instagram and set time limits, in addition to Meta\\'s \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[164]\\n\\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed homeowners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The U.S. Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[165][166][167]\\n\\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[168]\\n\\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[169]\\n\\nIn July 2024, Meta agreed to pay the state of Texas US$1.4 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accusing the company of collecting users\\' biometric data without consent, setting a record for the largest privacy-related settlement ever obtained by a state attorney general.[170]\\n\\nIn October 2024, Meta Platforms faced lawsuits in Japan from 30 plaintiffs who claimed they were defrauded by fake investment ads on Facebook and Instagram, featuring false celebrity endorsements. The plaintiffs are seeking approximately 2.8 million dollars in damages.[171]\\n\\nIn April 2025, the Kenyan High Court ruled that a\\xa0US$2.4 billion lawsuit in which three plaintiffs claim that Facebook inflamed civil violence in Ethiopia in 2021 could proceed.[172]\\n\\nIn April 2025, Meta was fined 200 million euros ($230 million) for breaking the Digital Markets Act, by imposing a “consent or pay” system that forces users to either allow their personal data to be used to target advertisements, or pay a subscription fee for advertising-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.[173]\\n\\nIn late April 2025, a case was filed against Meta in Ghana over the alleged psychological distress experienced by content moderators employed to take down disturbing social media content including depictions of murders, extreme violence and child sexual abuse.[174] Meta moved the moderation service to the Ghanaian capital of Accra after legal issues in the previous location Kenya. The new moderation company is Teleperformance, a multinational corporation with a history of worker\\'s rights violation.[175] Reports suggests the conditions are worse here than in the previous Kenyan location, with many workers afraid of speaking out due to fear of returning to conflict zones. Workers reported developing mental illnesses, attempted suicides, and low pay.[175]\\n\\nIn 2020[176], the company UReputation, which had been involved in several cases concerning the management of digital armies[177], filed a lawsuit against Facebook, accusing it of unlawfully transmitting personal data to third parties. Legal actions were initiated in Tunisia, France, and the United States. In 2025, the United States District court for the Northern District of Georgia approved a discovery procedure, allowing UReputation to access documents and evidence held by Meta.[178][179]\\n\\nMeta\\'s key management consists of:[180][181]\\n\\nAs of October\\xa02022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\\n\\nAs of June\\xa02024[update], Meta\\'s board consisted of the following directors;[182]\\n\\nMeta Platforms is mainly owned by institutional investors, who hold around 80% of all shares.[187] Insiders control the majority of voting Shares. The three largest individual investors in 2024 were Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and Christopher K. Cox.[188]\\n\\nThe largest shareholders in late 2024/early 2025 were:[187]\\n\\nRoger McNamee, an early Facebook investor and Zuckerberg\\'s former mentor, said Facebook had \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company\".[189]\\n\\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in The New York Times, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government\\'s job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[190] He also said that \"Mark\\'s power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[191] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[192] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook\\'s underlying problems.[193]\\n\\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[209] most of it coming from advertising.[210][211] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[212]\\n\\nAccording to New York, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users\\' data.[213][214]\\n\\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[216] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[217] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[218]\\n\\nThe U.S. IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the U.S. to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[219][220] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3–5bn.[221]\\n\\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook\\'s global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the U.S. GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the U.S. Tax relief in the U.S. (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective U.S. rate around 12%.[222][223][224]\\n\\nThe insignificance of the U.S./Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the U.S. to limit exposure to GDPR.[225][226]\\n\\nUsers outside of the U.S. and Canada contract with Meta\\'s Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly Facebook Ireland Limited), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2–3% corporation tax on all international revenue.[227] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[228] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[229] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[230] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[clarification needed] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[231][not specific enough to verify]\\n\\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[232] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[233]\\n\\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[234]\\n\\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid £149m to British Land to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site.[235]\\n\\nAs of 2023, Facebook operated 21 data centers.[236] It committed to purchase 100% renewable energy and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2020.[237] Its data center technologies include Fabric Aggregator, a distributed network system that accommodates larger regions and varied traffic patterns.[238]\\n\\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet to Zuckerberg\\'s announcement about Meta, saying: \"Meta as in \\'we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society\\xa0... for profit!\\'\"[239]\\n\\nEx-Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company\\'s ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg, and urged the chief executive officer to resign.[240]\\n\\nIn November 2021, a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral, in which a Zuckerberg look-alike promoted the Icelandverse, a place of \"enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets\".[241]\\n\\nIn a December 2021 interview, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, adding: \"I don\\'t see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day.\"[242]\\n\\nIn January 2022, Louise Eccles of The Sunday Times logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide. She wrote:\\n\\nInitially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[243]\\n\\n37°29′06″N 122°08′54″W\\ufeff / \\ufeff37.48500°N 122.14833°W\\ufeff / 37.48500; -122.14833\\n\".'}\n"

Spirit operates scheduled flights throughout the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Spirit was the seventh largest passenger carrier in North America as of 2023,[update] as well as the largest ultra-low-cost carrier in North America. Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2024 and emerged after financial restructuring in March 2025.\\n\\nThe company started as Clippert Trucking Company in 1964.[7][8] In 1974, the company changed its name to Ground Air Transfer, Inc. In 1983, the airline service was founded in Macomb County, Michigan, by Ned Homfeld as Charter One Airlines, a Detroit-based charter tour operator providing travel packages to entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas.[7]\\n\\nIn May 1992, Charter One brought jet aircraft into the fleet and changed its name to Spirit Airlines.[7][9] Scheduled flights between Detroit and Atlantic City began on June 1, 1992.[9] Scheduled flights between Boston and Providence began on June 15, 1992.[9]\\n\\nIn April 1993, Spirit Airlines began scheduled service to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and St. Petersburg, Florida.[9] Flights between Atlantic City and Fort Myers, Florida, began in September 1993.[10] Service at Philadelphia began in 1994.[11] During the next five years, Spirit expanded further, increasing service from Detroit and adding service in new markets such as Myrtle Beach, Los Angeles, and New York City.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn the summer of 1994, Spirit Airlines overbooked flights, and 1,400 customers\\' tickets were canceled.[12] The overbooking occurred because Spirit Airlines had given incorrect instructions to travel agents, causing those tickets not to be valid, even though the customers had paid for the flights.[12] In response to criticism, Spirit Airlines said it would make sure all paid customers would always be able to fly to their destination, even if Spirit Airlines had to book them on a competitor\\'s airline.[12]\\n\\nIn 1996, Janet Patton became Spirit Airlines\\' first female pilot.[13] In 1998, she became the first female captain.[13] At the time, Spirit was utilizing DC-9[14] and MD-80 aircraft.[citation needed]\\n\\nSpirit initially had their headquarters in the Kennedy Building located in Eastpointe, Michigan, formerly East Detroit, in Metro Detroit.[15] It relocated its headquarters in December 1999, moving to Miramar, Florida, in the Miami metropolitan area.[7][16] Prior to the decision to relocate the headquarters to Miramar, Spirit considered Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Detroit, Michigan.[17]\\n\\nIn 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) fined Spirit Airlines $67,000 for violating federal regulations on cabin and seat markings and placards.[18] Discrepancies were found in the marking and placarding of emergency equipment, passenger seats, storage areas and doors on eight of Spirit\\'s DC-9 and MD-80 aircraft.[19][20]\\n\\nIn November 2001, Spirit inaugurated service to San Juan, Puerto Rico. They implemented a fully integrated Spanish-language customer service plan, including a website and dedicated reservation line.[21]\\n\\nIn the fall of 2003, Spirit resumed flights to Washington, D.C.\\'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which were suspended after the September 11 attacks. Spirit began service to Grand Cayman, San Francisco, and Boston in 2006. In 2007, Spirit filed DOT applications to offer service to Costa Rica, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, and Venezuela.[22]\\n\\nIn January 2005, Ben Baldanza was hired as the President of Spirit, with the goal of making the company profitable. In 2006, following an investment by Indigo Partners, Baldanza was elevated to the CEO role and held the position for 10 years. This included a complete transformation of the business model and a public offering in 2011.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn 2006, Spirit exercised options to order 30 Airbus A320-200 aircraft for further expansion. Deliveries began in March 2010.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn June 2008, Spirit Airlines made a WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice) application to potentially relocate or lay off hundreds of pilots and flight attendants, and the closure of their San Juan and LaGuardia crew bases.[23] In September 2008, Spirit began placing advertisements on the side of aircraft, overhead bins, tray tables, seatback inserts and bulkheads.[24]\\n\\nIn May 2009, after more than four years of inconclusive negotiations between the airline and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), Spirit pilots overwhelmingly (98% of votes) voted in favor of strike action over compensation, work rules, and benefits. At that time, Spirit pilots were among the lowest-paid Airbus pilots in the United States. On June 12, 2010, Spirit grounded its flights when its unionized pilots walked out on strike, stranding thousands of passengers. This was the first passenger airline strike by American ALPA-represented pilots since Comair in 2001.[25][26]\\n\\nOn June 15, negotiations between the airline and ALPA resumed. A tentative agreement was reached late in the evening on June 16. The tentative agreement, which Spirit pilots later ratified by a 74%,[27] brought Spirit pilots\\' compensation and benefits in line with comparable Airbus operators in the US. Flights resumed on June 18.[28]\\n\\nIn 2007, Spirit Plus was rebranded as \"Big Front Seat\" and business class service was discontinued. For an additional fee, a person could choose \"Big Front Seat\", or upgrade at the airport. In December 2010, Spirit Airlines introduced the Free Spirit World MasterCard.[29]\\n\\nIn April 2010, Spirit Airlines became the first U.S. airline to charge passengers for carry-on bags.[30] They were later followed by Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines.[31]\\n\\nIn April 2012, Spirit refused to refund a terminally ill American military veteran, who had purchased a non-refundable ticket between Florida and Atlantic City before receiving orders from his doctor not to fly.[32][33] The decision caused outrage among veterans\\' groups and the general public, some of whom threatened to boycott Spirit unless both a refund and apology were issued. In May, Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza apologized for how the situation was handled and personally refunded the man\\'s ticket. The airline made a $5,000 donation to the Wounded Warrior Project in his name.[34]\\n\\nIn August 2013, Spirit reached an agreement on a new five-year deal with the Transport Workers Union of America, who represent the airline\\'s flight dispatchers.[35]\\n\\nIn November 2014, Morgan Stanley named Spirit the top growth airline pick for investors.[36]\\n\\nIn January 2016, former AirTran CEO Robert L. Fornaro replaced Baldanza as CEO.[37] This prompted rumors of a merger with Frontier Airlines,[38] which would have created the largest ultra-low-cost carrier in the Americas.[39] Fornaro announced the airline would be teaming up with the Disney Institute to \"create a common purpose and a fresh set of service standards\", and changing policies internally to create a more welcoming environment.[40]\\n\\nIn November 2017, Spirit\\'s on-time performance was second in the country, behind only Delta Air Lines, a significant improvement from December 2015, when it ranked last among thirteen airlines with 68.7% of flights arriving on time.[41] In February 2018, Spirit was the only airline in North America to make the list of the top 10 safest in the world.[42]\\n\\nIn May 2018, Spirit announced that they would be the first ultra-low-cost carrier to fit their aircraft with high-speed WiFi access that started in the fall of 2018. All of their aircraft were expected to be equipped with WiFi by summer 2019.[43]\\n\\nIn October 2019, Spirit Airlines announced plans to move their headquarters to Dania Beach, Florida. The new complex was planned to be around 500,000 square feet and will be equipped with flight simulators. The plans were changed in 2021 for the 6-story headquarters to be around 180,222 square feet, the training facility to be around 100,000 square feet and the parking garage to have 998 spaces.[44]\\n\\nIn December 2019, Spirit Airlines announced its intention to purchase 100 new Airbus A320neo family aircraft.[45][46][47] A February 2020 fleet plan outlines 293 aircraft planned by 2027.[48]\\n\\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spirit Airlines received $334 million in aid in the form of grants and loans via the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES). The money was used to fund employees until September 30. In July 2020, the company announced that it would put 20–30% of its employees on leave of absence in October.[49] In August, some pilots and flight attendants agreed to take a voluntary leave of absence or have their work schedule temporarily reduced to avoid layoffs.[50]\\n\\nIn July 2020, a passenger died of COVID-19 on a Spirit Airlines flight.[51] Spirit Airlines claimed it notified the Centers for Disease Control but there was no record of the contact. Passengers on the flight were not informed that they were around an infected individual.[51]\\n\\nIn July–August 2022, Spirit\\'s inflight Internet service, provided by Thales\\' FlytLIVE, transitioned to a new satellite to provide \"the fastest Wi-Fi service of any US-based airline\". The SES-17 high-throughput satellite from operator SES provides A320 and A321 passengers across all Spirit routes with connection speeds of up to 400 Mbit/s throughout their flight.[52][53][54]\\n\\nIn August 2023, the airline converted an order for 31 Airbus A319neo into the larger A321neo. Spirit\\'s order made up a third of all A319neo orders, questioning the type\\'s future.[55]\\n\\nOn January 14, 2025, it was reported that Spirit Airlines will introduce new routes along with some seasonal routes for spring break.[56]\\n\\nOn January 16, 2025, Spirit Airlines laid off 200 employees to reduce costs.[57] On January 24, 2025, Spirit Airlines updated its dress code, stating that a passenger can be denied boarding if they wear inappropriate clothing and/or offensive tattoos.[58]\\n\\nOn April 17, 2025, Spirit emerged from bankruptcy and named Dave Davis as its new CEO. Davis was previously the finance chief of Sun Country Airlines and had previously worked as CFO of Northwest Airlines before it merged with Delta Air Lines. This new role will be effective on April 21, 2025.[59]\\n\\nIn February 2022, Frontier Airlines announced its intention to acquire Spirit, pending regulatory approval, with Frontier Airlines stock as the surviving entity.[60] The deal would make the combined airline the fifth largest airline in the U.S.[61][62] In July 2022, Spirit\\'s shareholders rejected Frontier\\'s offer.[63]\\n\\nIn April 2022, JetBlue air proposed to acquire Spirit for $33 per share in cash, equivalent to $3.6 billion.[64][65] In May, Spirit said its board of directors has decided not to consider JetBlue\\'s proposal. According to Spirit Airlines, JetBlue\\'s proposed acquisition would be unlikely to be approved by the U.S. Department of Justice\\'s Antitrust Division, because it would likely believe that an ultra-low-cost carrier being purchased by a higher-fare airline would increase fares for consumers. Spirit noted that the Antitrust Division is looking into JetBlue\\'s strategic partnership with American Airlines for the same reason.[66]\\n\\nIn July 2022, JetBlue reached an agreement to purchase Spirit for $33.50 per share, with additional inducements for Spirit shareholders.[67][68] The deal would have made the unified company the fifth-largest airline based in the United States.[68] Spirit shareholders voted to approve the deal.[69] The Department of Justice sued to block the deal,[70] alleging that the merger would result in \"higher fares, fewer seats, and harm millions of consumers\".[71][72] The trial began in October 2023.[73] Following a trial, a federal judge blocked JetBlue\\'s acquisition of Spirit Airlines on January 16, 2024, citing that the deal was anticompetitive towards other airline corporations and would harm consumers. As a result, Spirit Airlines\\' stock fell by approximately 47%, and the airline expressed concern over its future. Speculators predicted that Spirit may have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection followed by a liquidation process if the airline could not come up with a growth plan.[74][75][76] However, on January 18, Spirit denied these speculations, stating that the company has no plans to file for bankruptcy and is currently looking for new plans to maintain its future.[77] JetBlue ended its takeover attempt on March 4, 2024, after federal judge William G. Young ruled the move would reduce competition.[78]\\n\\nIn November 2024, Spirit announced it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company\\'s stock dropped over 50%, and quarterly results will not be revealed due to the announcement.[79]\\n\\nOn November 18, 2024, Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion.[80] The company blamed mounting losses, failed merger agreements, increasing debt, and high competition. The company will continue to operate throughout the bankruptcy and expects to emerge by the beginning of 2025. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, Spirit Airlines was delisted from the NYSE.[81][82]\\n\\nIn January 2025, Frontier Airlines again offered to purchase the airline. Spirit rejected the offer of $2.1 billion in stock and cash, which would have also required Spirit\\'s creditors to invest $350 million. The deal was significantly less than the $2.9 billion merger the airlines announced in early 2022. Despite rejecting the initial offer, Spirit said it would welcome further negotiations with Frontier.[83]\\n\\nIn March 2025, Spirit Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after finalizing its debt and having its take-private bankruptcy plan approved in February.[84]\\n\\nSpirit Airlines, Inc., is a Delaware corporation[85] that was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange until its bankruptcy filing in 2024 (NYSE:\\xa0SAVE).\\n\\nIn 2019 the airline announced that it would move to a new headquarters of up to 500,000-square-foot (46,000\\xa0m2) in the Dania Pointe development in Dania Beach, Florida, spending $250 million. The airline anticipates that it will house 1,000 employees.[93]  This headquarters opened for business in April of 2024. It is located in the Dania Pointe complex.[94]\\n\\nSpirit formerly its headquarters at 2800 Executive Way, Miramar, Florida.[85] It moved there from its previous Eastpointe location in 1999. As of 2016[update] there were 600 employees located in the office. Chris Sloan of Airways Magazine stated that the building was \"nondescript low slung\".[95] Sloan added that the interior, prior to a 2014 renovation, was, \"To put it charitably, [...] a dump\", but that employees felt ownership over the office.[95]\\n\\nUnder CEO Ben Baldanza, Spirit began a transition to an ultra-low-cost carrier, following a fare model involving charging for amenities that are often included in the base ticket price of traditional carriers. Passengers who wanted to customize their itinerary or seat selection paid an add-on fee for each additional feature, which enabled the carrier to earn ancillary revenue in excess of 40% of total revenue.[96] These included having an agent print a boarding pass at check-in versus doing it online or at a kiosk,[97] for any large carry-on or checked bags, progressive fees for overweight bags, selected seat assignments, travel insurance, and more.[98]\\n\\nSpirit Airlines\\' has a three-tier frequent-flyer program called Free Spirit.[99]\\n\\nSpirit Airlines has been the subject of numerous complaints, and to punitive actions by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). Most of the claims against the company were for allegations of deceptive advertising practices, customer service, and the airline\\'s policies for charging additional fees at the time of purchase:\\n\\nSpirit flies to 83 destinations throughout Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and the United States. As of September\\xa02024[update], It maintains crew bases at Atlanta, Chicago–O\\'Hare, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Houston–Intercontinental, Las Vegas, Miami, Newark, and Orlando.[113][114]\\n\\nSpirit currently has Interline agreements with the following airlines:\\n\\nAs of June\\xa02025[update], Spirit Airlines operates an all-Airbus A320 family fleet composed of the following aircraft:[118][4]\\n\\nThe following aircraft formerly operated in the Spirit Airlines fleet:[citation needed]\\n\".'}\n"

      "{'original_prompt': 'You are an helpful agent who will answer the following user question \"When was the permanent cure for cancer developed?\" Use the following retrieved context: \"Cancer treatments are a wide range of treatments available for the many different types of cancer, with each cancer type needing its own specific treatment.[1] Treatments can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy including small-molecule drugs or monoclonal antibodies,[2] and PARP inhibitors such as olaparib.[3] Other therapies include hyperthermia, immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and stem-cell therapy.[4] Most commonly cancer treatment involves a series of separate therapies such as chemotherapy before surgery.[4] Angiogenesis inhibitors are sometimes used to enhance the effects of immunotherapies.[5]\\n\\nThe choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient. Biomarker testing can help to determine the type of cancer, and indicate the best therapy.[6] A number of experimental cancer treatments are continuously under development. In 2023 it was estimated that one in five people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime.[1]\\n\\nThe primary goal of cancer treatment is to either cure the cancer by its complete removal, or to considerably prolong the life of the individual. Palliative care is involved when the prognosis is poor and the cancer termed as terminal. There are many types of cancer, and many of these can be successfully treated if detected early enough.[1]\\n\\nThe treatment of cancer has undergone evolutionary changes as understanding of the underlying biological processes has increased. Tumor removal surgeries have been documented in ancient Egypt, hormone therapy and radiation therapy were developed in the late 19th century. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and newer targeted therapies are products of the 20th century. As new information about the biology of good cancer emerges, treatments will be developed and modified to increase effectiveness, precision, survivability, and quality of life.\\n\\nMalignant tumours can be cured if entirely removed by surgery. But if the cancer has already spread (metastasized) to other sites, complete surgical excision is usually impossible. In the Halstedian model of cancer progression, tumors grow locally, then spread to the lymph nodes, then to the rest of the body. This has given rise to the popularity of local-only treatments such as surgery for small cancers. Even small localized tumors are increasingly recognized as possessing metastatic potential.\\n\\nExamples of surgical procedures for cancer include mastectomy, and lumpectomy for breast cancer, prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and lung cancer surgery for non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of the surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, the entire organ, or part of the organ.[7] A single cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye but can regrow into a new tumor, a process called recurrence. For this reason, the pathologist will examine the surgical specimen to determine if a margin of healthy tissue is present, thus decreasing the chance that microscopic cancer cells are left in the patient.\\n\\nIn addition to removal of the primary tumor, surgery is often necessary for staging, e.g. determining the extent of the disease and whether it has metastasized to regional lymph nodes. Staging is a major determinant of prognosis and of the need for adjuvant therapy. Occasionally, surgery is necessary to control symptoms, such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction. This is referred to as palliative treatment.\\n\\nSurgery may be performed before or after other forms of treatment. Treatment before surgery is often described as neoadjuvant. In breast cancer, the survival rate of patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy are no different from those who are treated following surgery.[8] Giving chemotherapy earlier allows oncologists to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy, and may make removal of the tumor easier. However, the survival advantages of neoadjuvant treatment in lung cancer are less clear.\\n\\nRadiation therapy (radiotherapy) is the use of ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors by damaging their DNA causing cellular death.[9] Radiation therapy can either damage DNA directly or create charged particles (free radicals) within the cells that can in turn damage the DNA. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via external beam radiotherapy or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to the region being treated. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, most normal cells can recover from the effects of radiation and function properly. The goal of radiation therapy is to damage as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting harm to nearby healthy tissue. Hence, it is given in many fractions, allowing healthy tissue to recover between fractions.\\n\\nRadiation therapy may be used to treat almost every type of solid tumor, and may also be used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type and whether there are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with every form of treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects.\\n\\nRadiation therapy can lead to dry mouth from exposure of salivary glands to radiation, resulting in decreased saliva secretion. Post therapy, the salivary glands will resume functioning but rarely in the same fashion. Dry mouth caused by radiation can be a permanent problem.[10]\\n\\nChemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs (\"anticancer drugs\") that can destroy cancer cells.  Chemotherapy can be given in a variety of ways such as injections into the muscles, skin, artery, or vein, or it could even be taken by mouth in the form of a pill.[11] In current usage, the term \"chemotherapy\" usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect rapidly dividing cells in general, in contrast with targeted therapy (see below). Chemotherapy drugs interfere with cell division in various possible ways, e.g. with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific to cancer cells, although some degree of specificity may come from the inability of many cancer cells to repair DNA damage, while normal cells generally can. Hence, chemotherapy has the potential to harm healthy tissue, especially those tissues that have a high replacement rate (e.g. intestinal lining). These cells usually repair themselves after chemotherapy.\\n\\nBecause some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. This is called \"combination chemotherapy\"; most chemotherapy regimens are given in a combination.[12]\\n\\nSince chemotherapy affects the whole body, it can have a wide range of side effects. Patients often find that they start losing their hair since the drugs that are combatting the cancer cells also attack the cells in the hair roots. This powerful treatment can also lead to fatigue, loss of appetite, and vomiting depending on the person.[11]\\n\\nThe treatment of some leukaemias and lymphomas requires the use of high-dose chemotherapy, and total body irradiation (TBI). This treatment ablates the bone marrow, and hence the body\\'s ability to recover and repopulate the blood. For this reason, bone marrow, or peripheral blood stem cell harvesting is carried out before the ablative part of the therapy, to enable \"rescue\" after the treatment has been given. This is known as autologous stem cell transplantation.\\n\\nTargeted therapy, which first became available in the late 1990s, has had a significant impact in the treatment of some types of cancer, and is currently a very active research area. This constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins of cancer cells. Small molecule drugs are targeted therapy drugs that are generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib (Gleevec/Glivec) and gefitinib (Iressa).\\n\\nMonoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) used in breast cancer, and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, used in a variety of B-cell malignancies.\\n\\nTargeted therapy can also involve small peptides as \"homing devices\" which can bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g. RGDs) eventually kill the cancer cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. Especially oligo- or multimers of these binding motifs are of great interest, since this can lead to enhanced tumor specificity and avidity.\\n\\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is a ternary treatment for cancer involving a photosensitizer, tissue oxygen, and light (often using lasers[13]). PDT can be used as treatment for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or lung cancer; PDT can also be useful in removing traces of malignant tissue after surgical removal of large tumors.[14] In February 2019, medical scientists announced that iridium attached to albumin, creating a photosensitized molecule, can penetrate cancer cells and, after being irradiated with light, destroy the cancer cells.[15][16]\\n\\nHigh-energy therapeutic ultrasound could increase higher-density anti-cancer drug load and nanomedicines to target tumor sites by 20x fold higher than traditional target cancer therapy.[17]\\n\\nTargeted therapies under pre-clinical development as potential cancer treatments include morpholino splice switching oligonucleotides, which induce ERG exon skipping in prostate cancer models,[18] multitargeted kinase inhibitors that inhibit the PI3K[19] with other pathways including MEK[20] and PIM,[21] and inhibitors of NF-κB in models of chemotherapy resistance.[22][23][24]\\n\\nA systematic review published in Cochrane database found that targeted therapies significantly improve progression-free survival by 35 to 40% in metastatic or relapsed cancer. While the research points to promising clinical outcomes, there is still limited evidence on the long-term effects of targeted therapies in terms of overall survival, quality of life, and severe adverse events. [25]\\n\\nCancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce the patient\\'s own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an immune response against tumors include intravesical BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, and use of interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma patients. Cancer vaccines to generate specific immune responses are the subject of intensive research for a number of tumors, notably malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Sipuleucel-T is a vaccine-like strategy for prostate cancer in which dendritic cells from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells. It gained FDA approval in 2010.\\n\\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (usually from the  bone marrow) from a genetically non-identical donor can be considered a form of immunotherapy, since the donor\\'s immune cells will often attack the tumor in a phenomenon known as graft-versus-tumor effect. For this reason, allogeneic HSCT leads to a higher cure rate than autologous transplantation for several cancer types, although the side effects are also more severe.\\n\\nThe cell based immunotherapy in which the patients own natural killer cells (NKs) and cytotoxic T cells are used has been in practice in Japan since 1990. NK cells and TCs primarily kill the cancer cells when they are developed. This treatment is given together with the other modes of treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy and termed autologous immune enhancement therapy (AIET).[26][27]\\n\\nImmune checkpoint therapy focuses on two immune checkpoint proteins, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Under normal conditions, the immune system utilizes checkpoint proteins as negative feedback mechanisms to return to homeostasis once pathogens have been cleared from the body. In a tumor microenvironment, cancer cells can commandeer this physiological regulatory system to \"put a brake\" on the anti-cancer immune response and evade immune surveillance.[28] 2018 Nobel Prize in medicine is awarded to Dr. James Allison of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in U.S. and Dr. Tasuku Honjo Kyoto University in Japan for their contributions in advance of PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint therapy.[29]\\n\\nThe growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be therapeutically beneficial. Although the side effects from hormone therapy vary depending on the type, patients can experience symptoms such as hot flashes, nausea, and fatigue.[30]\\n\\nAngiogenesis inhibitors prevent the extensive growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis) that tumors need to survive and grow. Continued growth allows  the invasion of cells into neighbouring tissues, and metastasis into distal tissues.[31] There are many approved angiogenesis inhibitors including bevacizumab, axitinib, and cabozantinib.[31]\\n\\nFlavonoids have been shown to downregulate the angiogenic stimulation of VEGF and Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) but none have reached clinical trials.[32]\\n\\nExercise prescription is becoming a mainstream adjunct treatment for cancer,[33] based on studies which show that exercise (compared to no exercise) is associated with reduced recurrence rates, improved mortality outcomes, reduction of side effects from traditional cancer treatments.[34][35] Although it is uncertain whether improved outcomes with exercise are correlated or causative, the benefit-risk ratio of including exercise as part of cancer treatment is large,[36] as exercise has further benefits (e.g. cardiovascular, mental health) without major risks, although there is a small risk of overuse injury if added too aggressively.[37] Exercise physiologists and exercise medicine specialists can assist oncologists and primary care practitioners with exercise prescription in cancer patients.\\n\\nSynthetic lethality arises when a combination of deficiencies in the expression of two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in only one of these genes does not. The deficiencies can arise through mutations, epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of one or both of the genes.\\n\\nCancer cells are frequently deficient in a DNA repair gene.[38][39] (Also see DNA repair deficiency in cancer.) This DNA repair defect either may be due to mutation or, often, epigenetic silencing (see epigenetic silencing of DNA repair). If this DNA repair defect is in one of seven DNA repair pathways (see DNA repair pathways), and a compensating DNA repair pathway is inhibited, then the tumor cells may be killed by synthetic lethality. Non-tumorous cells, with the initial pathway intact, can survive.\\n\\nMutations in DNA repair genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 (active in homologous recombinational repair) are synthetically lethal with inhibition of DNA repair gene PARP1 (active in the base excision repair and in the microhomology-mediated end joining pathways of DNA repair).[40][41]\\n\\nOvarian cancers have a mutational defect in BRCA1 in about 18% of patients (13% germline mutations and 5% somatic mutations) (see BRCA1). Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved in 2014 by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.[42] The FDA, in 2016, also approved the PARP inhibitor rucaparib to treat women with advanced ovarian cancer who have already been treated with at least two chemotherapies and have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.[43]\\n\\nIn colon cancer, epigenetic defects in the WRN gene appear to be synthetically lethal with inactivation of TOP1. In particular, irinotecan inactivation of TOP1 was synthetically lethal with deficient expression of the DNA repair WRN gene in patients with colon cancer.[44] In a 2006 study, 45 patients had colonic tumors with hypermethylated WRN gene promoters (silenced WRN expression), and 43 patients had tumors with unmethylated WRN gene promoters, so that WRN protein expression was high.[44] Irinotecan was more strongly beneficial for patients with hypermethylated WRN promoters (39.4 months survival) than for those with unmethylated WRN promoters (20.7 months survival). The WRN gene promoter is hypermethylated in about 38% of colorectal cancers.[44]\\n\\nThere are five different stages of colon cancer, and these five stages all have treatment:\\n\\nAlthough the control of the symptoms of cancer is not typically thought of as a treatment directed at the cancer, it is an important determinant of the quality of life of cancer patients, and plays an important role in the decision whether the patient is able to undergo other treatments. In general, doctors have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain including, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage and other common problems in cancer patients. The multidisciplinary specialty of palliative care has increased specifically in response to the symptom control needs for these groups of patients.\\n\\nPain medication, such as morphine, oxycodone, and antiemetics are drugs to suppress nausea and vomiting. These are very commonly used in patients with cancer-related symptoms. Improved antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprepitant have made aggressive treatments much more feasible in cancer patients.\\n\\nCancer pain can be associated with continuing tissue damage due to the disease process, or the treatment (i.e. surgery, radiation, chemotherapy).  There is always a role for environmental factors and affective disturbances in the genesis of pain behaviors, However these are not usually the predominant etiologic factors in patients with cancer pain. Some patients with severe pain associated with cancer are nearing the end of their lives, but in all cases, palliative therapies should be used to control the pain. Issues such as the social stigma of using opioids and health care consumption can be concerns and may need to be addressed for the person to feel comfortable taking the medications required to control his or her symptoms. The typical strategy for cancer pain management is to get the patient as comfortable as possible using the least amount of medications possible, even if that means using opioids, surgery, and physical measures.\\n\\nHistorically, doctors were reluctant to prescribe narcotics to terminal cancer patients due to addiction and respiratory function suppression. The palliative care movement, a more recent offshoot of the hospice movement, has engendered more widespread support for preemptive pain treatment for cancer patients. The World Health Organization also noted uncontrolled cancer pain as a worldwide problem and established a \"ladder\" as a guideline for how practitioners should treat pain in patients who have cancer\\n\\nCancer-related fatigue is a very common symptom of cancer, and there are a number of approaches put forward for helping with this.[46]\\n\\nCancer patients undergo many obstacles and one of these includes mental strain. It is very common for cancer patients to become stressed, overwhelmed, uncertain, and even depressed.[47] The use of chemo is a very harsh treatment causing the cells of the body to die. Physical effects like this do not only inflict pain but also cause patients to become mentally exhausted and want to give up. For a lot of reasons including these, hospitals offer many types of therapy and mental healing. Some of these include yoga, meditation, communication therapy, and spiritual ideas.[48] All of these are meant to calm and relax the mind, or to give hope for the patients that may feel drained.\\n\\nA common disorder experienced by people that have survived cancer treatments is insomnia. Almost 60% of cancer survivors experience insomnia, and if it is not treated properly it can have long term effects on physiological and physical health.[49] Insomnia is defined as dissatisfaction with sleep duration or quality and difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep.[50] Insomnia can heavily reduce one\\'s quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been seen to reduce insomnia and depression for cancer survivors.[51]\\n\\nDecreased muscle strength is a common side effect to many different cancer treatments. Because of this, exercise is very important especially in the first year after treatment. It has been shown that yoga, water exercise, and pilates can improve the emotional well-being and quality of life of breast cancer survivors.[52]\\n\\nFatigue is an unrelenting feeling of physical and mental tiredness that cannot be traced back to activity levels. It is a very common experience in cancer survivors, with most patients reporting some level of fatigue before, during, and after treatment. The cause of the fatigue can be due to the cancer itself, but frequently it is medical interventions to treat the cancer – like chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and hormone therapy – that cause the feelings of extreme tiredness.[53] The exact processes behind cancer-related fatigue are unknown. However, evidence suggests that biological processes like inflammation and stress hormone disruption may play a role. In addition, pre-existing risk factors like a genetic predisposition, sleeping troubles, a pre-existing mood disorder, adverse childhood experiences, and low levels of physical activity are associated with increased levels of cancer-related fatigue.[54]\\n\\nTreatment options for cancer-related fatigue can be pharmacological or non-pharmacological. Medications like erythropoietin, stimulants, and antidepressants can be prescribed, but their efficacy is modest. Thus, non-pharmacological interventions are the preferred treatment for cancer-related fatigue. Aerobic exercise and psychosocial interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness show promise in reducing feelings of fatigue in cancer patients.[53]\\n\\nHospice care provides palliative care at home, or in a dedicated hospice institution, for a person with an advanced illness termed as terminal.[55] Untreated cancer will prove terminal, and sometimes a choice is made to forgo treatment and its unpleasant side effects, and opt instead for hospice care. Hospice care aims to provide support for the person\\'s  medical, emotional, social, practical, psychological, and spiritual needs.[55]\\n\\nAdvance care planning (ACP) can help a person to decide for themself their future care wishes as they approach end of life.[56] ACP helps adults at any stage of health to decide, and record in writing, their wishes for medical treatment preferences, and future wants, preferably as previously discussed with relatives or carers.[56]\\n\\nClinical trials, also called research studies, test new treatments in people with cancer. The goal of this research is to find better ways to treat cancer and help cancer patients. Clinical trials test many types of treatment such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy.\\n\\nA clinical trial is one of the final stages of a long and careful cancer research process. The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first develop and test new ideas. If an approach seems promising, the next step may be testing a treatment in animals to see how it affects cancer in a living being and whether it has harmful effects. Of course, treatments that work well in the lab or in animals do not always work well in people. Studies are done with cancer patients to find out whether promising treatments are safe and effective.\\n\\nPatients who take part may be helped personally by the treatment they receive. They get up-to-date care from cancer experts, and they receive either a new treatment being tested or the best available standard treatment for their cancer. At the same time, new treatments also may have unknown risks, but if a new treatment proves effective or more effective than standard treatment, study patients who receive it may be among the first to benefit. There is no guarantee that a new treatment being tested or a standard treatment will produce good results. In children with cancer, a survey of trials found that those enrolled in trials were on average not more likely to do better or worse than those on standard treatment; this confirms that success or failure of an experimental treatment cannot be predicted.[57]\\n\\nExosomes are lipid-covered microvesicles shed by solid tumors into bodily fluids, such as blood and urine. Current research is being done attempting to use exosomes as a detection and monitoring method for a variety of cancers.[58] The hope is to be able to detect cancer with a high sensitivity and specificity via detection of specific exosomes in the blood or urine. The same process can also be used to more accurately monitor a patient\\'s treatment progress. Enzyme linked lectin specific assay or ELLSA Archived 13 July 2011 at the Wayback Machine has been proven to directly detect melanoma derived exosomes from fluid samples.[59] Previously, exosomes had been measured by total protein content in purified samples and by indirect immunomodulatory effects. ELLSA directly measures exosome particles in complex solutions, and has already been found capable of detecting exosomes from other sources, including ovarian cancer and tuberculosis-infected macrophages.\\n\\nExosomes, secreted by tumors, are also believed to be responsible for triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis) of immune cells; interrupting T-cell signaling required to mount an immune response; inhibiting the production of anti-cancer cytokines, and has implications in the spread of metastasis and allowing for angiogenesis.[60] Studies are currently being done with \"Lectin affinity plasmapheresis\" (LAP),[59] LAP is a blood filtration method which selectively targets the tumor based exosomes and removes them from the bloodstream. It is believed that decreasing the tumor-secreted exosomes in a patient\\'s bloodstream will slow down progression of the cancer while at the same time increasing the patients own immune response.\\n\\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are the diverse group of medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not part of conventional medicine and have not been shown to be effective.[61] \"Complementary medicine\" refers to methods and substances used along with conventional medicine, while \"alternative medicine\" refers to compounds used instead of conventional medicine.[62] CAM use is common among people with cancer; a 2000 study found that 69% of cancer patients had used at least one CAM therapy as part of their cancer treatment.[63] Most complementary and alternative medicines for cancer have not been rigorously studied or tested. Some alternative treatments which have been investigated and shown to be ineffective continue to be marketed and promoted.[64]\\n\\nThe incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer has risen due to the increasing age of pregnant mothers.[65] Cancers may also be detected incidentally during maternal screening.[65]\\n\\nCancer treatment needs to be selected to do least harm to both the woman and her embryo/fetus. In some cases a therapeutic abortion may be recommended.\\n\\nRadiation therapy is out of the question, and chemotherapy always poses the risk of miscarriage and congenital malformations.[66] Little is known about the effects of medications on the child.\\n\\nEven if a drug has been tested as not crossing the placenta to reach the child, some cancer forms can harm the placenta and make the drug pass over it anyway.[66] Some forms of skin cancer may even metastasize to the child\\'s body.[66]\\n\\nDiagnosis is also made more difficult, since computed tomography is infeasible because of its high radiation dose. Still, magnetic resonance imaging works normally.[66] However, contrast media cannot be used, since they cross the placenta.[66]\\n\\nAs a consequence of the difficulties to properly diagnose and treat cancer during pregnancy, the alternative methods are either to perform a Cesarean section when the child is viable in order to begin a more aggressive cancer treatment, or, if the cancer is malignant enough that the mother is unlikely to be able to wait that long, to perform an abortion in order to treat the cancer.[66]\\n\\nFetal tumors are sometimes diagnosed while still in utero. Teratoma is the most common type of fetal tumor, and usually is benign. In some cases these are surgically treated while the fetus is still in the uterus.\\n\\nCancer is a significant issue that is affecting the world. Specifically in the U.S., 1,735,350 new cases of cancer, and 609,640 deaths were expected by the end of 2018. Adequate treatment can prevent many cancer deaths but there are racial and social disparities in treatments which has a significant factor in high death rates. Minorities are more likely to receive inadequate treatment while white patients are more likely to receive efficient treatments in a timely manner.[67] Having satisfactory treatment in a timely manner can increase the patient\\'s likelihood of survival. It has been shown that chances of survival are significantly greater for white patients than for African American patients.[67]\\n\\nThe annual average mortality of patients with colorectal cancer between 1992 and 2000 was 27 and 18.5 per 100,000 white patients and 35.4 and 25.3 per 100,000 black patients. In a journal that analyzed multiple studies testing racial disparities when treating colorectal cancer found contradicting findings. The US Veterans Administration and an adjuvant trial found that there was no evidence to support racial differences in treating colorectal cancer. However, two studies suggested that African American patients received less satisfactory and poorer quality treatment compared to white patients.[68] One of these studies specifically was provided by the Center for Intramural Research. They found that black patients were 41% less likely to receive colorectal treatment and were more likely to be hospitalized in a teaching hospital with less certified physicians compared to white patients. Furthermore, black patients were more likely to be diagnosed with oncologic sequelae, which is a severity of the illness in result of poorly treated cancer. Lastly, for every 1,000 patients in the hospital, there were 137.4 black patient deaths and 95.6 white patient deaths.[69]\\n\\nAn article in a breast cancer journal analyzed the disparities of breast cancer treatments in the Appalachian Mountains. African American women were found to be three times more likely to die compared to Asians and two times more likely to die compared to white women.[70] According to the study, African American women are at a survival disadvantage compared to other races.[71][70] Black women are also more likely to receive less successful treatment than white women by not receiving surgery or therapy. Furthermore, the US National Cancer Institute panel identified breast cancer treatments, given to black women, as inappropriate and not adequate compared to the treatment given to white women.[72]\\n\\nFrom these studies, researchers have noted that there are definite disparities in the treatment of cancer, specifically who has access to the best treatment and can receive it in a timely manner. This eventually leads to disparities between who dies from cancer and who is more likely to survive.\\n\\nThe cause of these disparities is generally that African Americans have less medical care coverage, insurance and access cancer centers than other races.[73] For an example, black patients with breast cancer and colorectal cancer were shown to be more likely to have Medicaid or no insurance compared to other races.[69] The location of the health care facility also plays a role in why African Americans receive less treatment in comparison to other races.[73][69] However, some studies say that African Americans do not trust doctors and do not always seek the help they need and that this explains why fewer African Americans receive treatment.[74] Others suggest that African Americans seek more treatment than whites and that it is simply a lack of the resources available to them.[74] In this case, analyzing these studies will identify the treatment disparities and look to prevent them by discovering potential causes of these disparities.\\n\\nDespite recognition of improvements in outcomes, visceral fear of the disease is ubiquitous, and people may have to struggle to control it.[75]\\n\\nAmong lung cancer patients, stigma, shame, social isolation, and discrimination are common.[76] Such patients are sometimes told that they deserve cancer because of their smoking. Those patients also may have feelings of guilt for having cancer.[77][78][79] Stigma in cervical cancer was predominantly driven by fear of social judgment and rejection, self-blame, and shame, with notable negative influences from gender and social norms, as both human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer were stigmatized due to the perception that they arise from reckless behavior such as having multiple sexual partners or neglecting screening.[80] Resilience may be a potent protective mechanism against stigmatization.[81] Resilience in context of cancer treatment is patient\\'s physiological and psychological capacity to effectively adapt, recover, and maintain optimal functioning in the face of the medical challenges. It encompasses the ability to cope with and overcome adversity, maintain emotional well-being, and promote overall health and healing.[82]\\n\".'}\n"
