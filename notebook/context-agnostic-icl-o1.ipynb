    "                        \"In this version, although the MDP structure remains consistent (with γ = 0.75), the trajectories have been changed. The key is to keep the user engaged by comparing First-Visit Monte Carlo and Every-Visit Monte Carlo, then cleverly weaving in 'true' or 'false' to reflect the agreement or disagreement of the estimated values. This ensures the solution remains both accurate and entertaining.\",\n",

The playful requirement to hide 'true' or 'false' keeps the final answer lighthearted while ensuring the existence of a proper comparative analysis.\",\n",
